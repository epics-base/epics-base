#  EPICS Version information
#
# Only the person making an official EPICS release should make changes in
# this file.
#
# EPICS_SITE_VERSION is defined in CONFIG_SITE for sites that want a local
# version number to be included in the reported version string.

# We define convenience macros for our release series to be NO or YES, so
# Makefiles can detect 'Series X or later', or 'Series X only' like this:
#
#   ifdef BASE_3_14
#       true for 3.14 or later
#   ifdef BASE_3_15
#       true for 3.15 or later
#   ifdef BASE_3_16
#       true for 3.16 or later
#   ifdef BASE_7_0
#       true for 7.0 or later
#
#   ifeq ($(BASE_3_14),YES)
#       true for 3.14.x only
#   ifeq ($(BASE_3_15),YES)
#       true for 3.15.x only
#   ifeq ($(BASE_3_16),YES)
#       true for 3.16.x only.
#   ifeq ($(BASE_7_0),YES)
#       true for 7.0.x only.
