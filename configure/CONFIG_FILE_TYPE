# Macros and rules to create a new installation file type 
#

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Module developers can now define a new type of file, e.g. ABC,
# so that files of type ABC will be installed into a directory
# defined by INSTALL_ABC. This is done by creating a new CONFIG<name>
# file, e.g. CONFIG_ABC, with the following lines:
#
#       FILE_TYPE += ABC
#       INSTALL_ABC = $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/abc
#
# The INSTALL_ABC directory should be be a subdirectory of 
# $(INSTALL_LOCATION). The file type ABC should be target
# architecture independent (alh files, medm files, edm files).
#
# Files of type ABC are then installed into the INSTALL_ABC
# directory by adding a line like the following to a Makefile.
#
#       ABC += <filename1> <filename2> <filename3>
#
# Rules necessary to create files of type ABC should be put in
# a RULES_ABC file. Variables used by those rules should appear
# in a CONFIG_ABC file.
#
# The module developer installs new CONFIG* or RULES* files
# into the directory $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/cfg by including the 
# following Makefile line:
#
#       CFG += CONFIG_ABC RULES_ABC
# 
# CONFIG and RULES files in the $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/cfg directory
# are included by the Base config files so their definitions and
# rules are available for use by later src directory Makefiles in
# the same module, or by other modules with a RELEASE line that
# points to the TOP of the module providing these files.
