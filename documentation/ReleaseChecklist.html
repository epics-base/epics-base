<h1>EPICS Base Release Procedures &amp; Checklist</h1>

<p>This document describes the procedures and provides a checklist of tasks
that should be performed when creating production releases of EPICS Base.</p>

<h3>The Release Process</h3>

<p>The version released on the Feature Freeze date is designated the first
pre-release, <tt>-pre1</tt>. The first release candidate <tt>-rc1</tt> is the
first version that has undergone widespread testing and which has no known
problems in it that are slated to be fixed in this release. New versions should
be made at about weekly intervals during the testing and debugging period, and
will be designated as either pre-release or release candidate versions by the
Release Manager. After a release candidate has been available to the whole
community for testing for at least a week without any additional problems being
reported or significant changes being committed, the branch can be designated as
the final release version.</p>

<h3>Roles</h3>

<p>The following roles are used below:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Release Manager</strong> ()</dt>
    <dd>Responsible for managing and tagging the release</dd>
  <dt><strong>Platform Developers</strong> (optional)</dt>

  <dt><strong>Application Developers</strong></dt>
    <dd>Responsible for support modules that depend on EPICS Base.</dd>
