<h3>Title...</h3>

<p>Description</p>

-->

<h3>IOC Database Support for 64-bit integers</h3>

<p>The IOC now supports the 64-bit integer field types <tt>DBF_INT64</tt> and
<tt>DBF_UINT64</tt>, and there are new record types <tt>int64in</tt> and
<tt>int64out</tt> derived from the <tt>longin</tt> and <tt>longout</tt> types
respectively that use the <tt>DBF_INT64</tt> data type for their VAL and related
fields. The usual range of Soft Channel device support are included for these
new record types.</p>

<p>All internal IOC APIs such as dbAccess can handle the new field types and
their associated request values <tt>DBR_INT64</tt> and <tt>DBR_UINT64</tt>,
which are implemented using the <tt>epicsInt64</tt> and <tt>epicsUInt64</tt>
typedef's from the <tt>epicsTypes.h</tt> header.</p>

<p>The waveform record type has been updated to support these new field types.
<strong>All waveform device support layers must be updated to recognize the new
type enumeration values</strong>, which had to be inserted before the
<tt>FLOAT</tt> value in the enum <tt>dbfType</tt> and in <tt>menuFtype</tt>. C
or C++ code can detect at compile-time whether this version of base provides
64-bit support by checking for the presence of the <tt>DBR_INT64</tt> macro as
follows (Note that <tt>DB<b>F</b>_INT64</tt> is an enum tag and not a
preprocessor macro):</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#ifdef DBR_INT64
    /* Code where Base has INT64 support */
#else
    /* Code for older versions */
#endif
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Channel Access does not (and probably never will) directly support 64-bit
integer types, so the new field types are presented to the CA server as
<tt>DBF_DOUBLE</tt> values. This means that field values larger than 2^52
(0x10_0000_0000_0000 = 4503599627370496) cannot be transported over Channel
Access without their least significant bits being truncated. The EPICS V4
pvAccess network protocol <em>can</em> transport 64-bit data types however, and
a future release of the pvaSrv module will connect this ability to the IOC.</p>


<h3>Echoless comments in iocsh</h3>

<p>The way comments are parsed by the iocsh interpreter has changed. The
interpreter can be selectively disabled from echoing comments coming from
a script by starting those lines with '#-' rather than just '#'.</p>


<hr>

<h2 align="center">Changes made between 3.15.3 and 3.16.0.1</h2>

<h3>Build support for CapFast and dbst removed</h3>

<p>The build rules associated with the CapFast-related tools <tt>sch2edif</tt>
and <tt>e2db</tt> and the <q>database optimization</q> tool <tt>dbst</tt> have
been removed, along with the <tt>DB_OPT</tt> build configuration variable.</p>

<h3>compressRecord buffering order</h3>

<p>The compressRecord has a new field <tt>BALG</tt> which can select between
FIFO (append) and LIFO (prepend) ordering for insertion of new elements. FIFO
ordering is the default, matching the behviour of previous versions.</p>

<h3>Valgrind Instrumentation</h3>

<p>Valgrind is a software debugging suite provided by many Linux distributions.
The header valgrind/valgrind.h is now included in, and installed by, Base.
When included by a C or C++ source file this header defines some macros which
expand to provide hints to the Valgrind runtime.
These have no effect on normal operation of the software, but when run using the
valgrind tool they can help to find memory leaks and buffer overflows.
Suitable hints have been added to several free-lists within libCom, including
freeListLib, allowing valgrind to provide more accurate information about the
source of potential leaks.</p>

<p>valgrind.h automatically disables itself when the build target is not
supported by the valgrind tool.
It can also explicitly be disabled by defining the macro <em>NVALGRIND</em>.
See <em>src/libCom/Makefile</em> for a commented-out example.</p>

<p>As a matter of policy valgrind.h will never be included by any header file
installed by Base, so its use will remain purely an implementation
detail hidden from application software.
Support modules which choose to use valgrind.h are advised to do
likewise.</p>

<h3>Database Multi-locking</h3>

<p>The IOC record locking code has been re-written with an expanded API; global
locks are no longer required by the IOC database implementation.</p>

<p>The new API functions center around dbScanLockMany(), which behaves like
dbScanLock() applied to an arbitrary group of records. dbLockerAlloc() is used
to prepare a list or record pointers, then dbScanLockMany() is called. When it
returns, all of the records listed may be accessed (in any order) until
dbScanUnlockMany() is called.</p>

<p>The Application Developer's Guide has been updated to describe the API and
implementation is more detail.</p>

<p>Previously a global mutex 'lockSetModifyLock' was locked and unlocked during
dbScanLock(), acting as a sequencing point for otherwise unrelated calls. The
new dbLock.c implementation does not include any global mutex in dbScanLock() or
dbScanLockMany(). Locking/unlocking of unrelated lock sets is now completely
concurrent.</p>

<h3>Generate Version Header</h3>

<p>A Perl script and Makefile rules have been added to allow modules to generate
a C header file with a macro defined with an automatically updated identifier.
This is a VCS revision ID (Darcs, Git, Mercurial, Subversion, and Bazaar are
supported) or the date/time of the build if no VCS system is in use.</p>

<p>The makeBaseApp example template has been updated with a new device support
which makes this identifier visible via a lsi (long string input) record.</p>

<h3>epicsTime API return status</h3>

<p>The epicsTime routines that used to return epicsTimeERROR now return a
specific S_time_ status value, allowing the caller to discover the reason for
any failure. The identifier <tt>epicsTimeERROR</tt> is no longer defined, so any
references to it in source code will no longer compile. The identifier
epicsTimeOK still exists and has the value 0 as before, so most code that uses
these APIs can be changed in a way that is backwards-compatible with the
previous return status.</p>

<p>Time providers that have to return a status value and still need to be built
with earlier versions of Base can define the necessary status symbols like
this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include "epicsTime.h"

#ifndef M_time
/* S_time_... status values were not provided before Base 3.16 */
#define S_time_unsynchronized epicsTimeERROR
#define S_time_...whatever... epicsTimeERROR
#endif
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Refactoring of epicsReadline</h3>

<p>The epicsReadline code has been reorganized to allow the commandline history
editor to be disabled at runtime. The EPICS_COMMANDLINE_LIBRARY build setting
still selects the preferred editor, but the new <tt>IOCSH_HISTEDIT_DISABLE</tt>
environment variable can be set at runtime to disable history editing and make
the IOC or other program use the basic editor instead. This is useful when
starting and controlling an IOC from another program through its stdin and
stdout streams since history editors often insert invisible escape codes into
the stdout stream, making it hard to parse.</p>

<h3>Callback subsystem API</h3>

<p>Added a new macro <tt>callbackGetPriority(prio, callback)</tt> to the
callback.h header and removed the need for dbScan.c to reach into the internals
of its CALLBACK objects.</p>


<h2 align="center">Changes from the 3.15 branch since 3.15.5</h2>

<!-- Insert inherited items immediately below here ... -->


<h2 align="center">Changes from the 3.14 branch since 3.15.5</h2>

<!-- Insert inherited items immediately below here ... -->

<h3>Server bind issue on Windows</h3>

<p>When a National Instruments network variables CA server is already running on
a Windows system and an IOC or PCAS server is started, the IOC's attempt to
bind a TCP socket to the CA server port number fails, but Windows returns a
different error status value than the IOC is expecting in that circumstance
(because the National Instruments code requests exclusive use of that port,
unlike the EPICS code) so the IOC fails to start properly. The relevent EPICS
bind() checks have now been updated so the IOC will request that a dynamic port
number be allocated for this TCP socket instead when this happens.</p>

<h3>Checking Periodic Scan Rates</h3>

<p>Code has been added to the IOC startup to better protect it against bad
periodic scan rates, including against locales where <q><tt>.</tt></q> is not
accepted as a decimal separator character. If the scan period in a menuScan
choice string cannot be parsed, the associated periodic scan thread will no
longer be started by the IOC and a warning message will be displayed at iocInit
time. The <tt>scanppl</tt> command will also flag the faulty menuScan value.</p>


<h2 align="center">Changes made between 3.15.4 and 3.15.5</h2>

<h3>dbStatic Library Speedup and Cleanup</h3>

<p>Loading of database files has been optimized to avoid overproportionally
long loading times for large databases. As a part of this, the alphabetical
ordering of records instances (within a record type) has been dropped. In the
unexpected case that applications were relying on the alphabetic order, setting
<tt>dbRecordsAbcSorted = 1</tt> before loading the databases will retain the
old behavior.</p>

<p>The routine <tt>dbRenameRecord()</tt> has been removed, as it was intended
to be used by database configuration tools linked against a host side version
of the dbStatic library that is not being built anymore.</p>

<h3>Launchpad Bug-fixes</h3>

<p>In addition to the more detailed change descriptions below, the following
Launchpad bugs have also been fixed in this release:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/epics-base/+bug/1440186">
    #1440186</a> Crash due to a too small buffer being provided in
    dbContextReadNotifyCache</li>
  <li><a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/epics-base/+bug/1479316">
    #1479316</a> Some data races found using Helgrind</li>
  <li><a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/epics-base/+bug/1495833">
    #1495833</a> biRecord prompt groups are nonsensical</li>
  <li><a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/epics-base/+bug/1606848">
    #1606848</a> WSAIoctl SIO_GET_INTERFACE_LIST failed in Windows</li>
</ul>

<h3>Whole-Program Optimization for MS Visual Studio Targets</h3>

<p>When using the Microsoft compilers a new build system variable is provided
that controls whether whole program optimization is used or not. For static
builds using Visual Studio 2010 this optimization must be disabled. This is
controlled in the files configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.Common.windows-x64-static and
configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.Common.win32-x86-static by setting the variable
<tt>OPT_WHOLE_PROGRAM&nbsp;=&nbsp;NO</tt> to override the default value
<tt>YES</tt> that would otherwise be used.</p>

<p>Note that enabling this optimization slows down the build process. It is not
possible to selectively disable this optimization, when building a particular
module say; Microsoft's linker will restart itself automatically with the
<tt>-LTCG</tt> flag set and display a warning if it is asked to link any object
files that were compiled with the <tt>-GL</tt> flag.</p>

<h3>Add dynamic (variable length) array support to PCAS</h3>

<p>Dynamic array sizing support was added to the IOC server (RSRV) in the
Base-3.14.12 release, but has not until now been supported in the <q>Portable
Channel Access Server</q> (PCAS). Channel Access server applications using the
PCAS may not need to be modified at all; if they already push monitors with
different gdd array lengths, those variable sizes will be forwarded to any CA
clients who have requested variable length updates. The example CAS server
application has been modified to demonstrate this feature.</p>

<p>In implementing the above, the gdd method <tt>gdd::put(const gdd *)</tt> now
copies the full-sized array from the source gdd if the destination gdd is of
type array, has no allocated memory and a boundary size of 0.</p>

<h3>Additional epicsTime conversion</h3>

<p>The EPICS timestamp library (epicsTime) inside libCom's OSI layer has
been extended by routines that convert from <tt>struct tm</tt> to the EPICS
internal <tt>epicsTime</tt> type, assuming UTC - i.e. without going through
the timezone mechanism. This solves issues with converting from the structured
type to the EPICS timestamp at driver level from multiple threads at a high
repetition rate, where the timezone mechanism was blocking on file access.</p>

<h3>MinGW Cross-builds from Linux</h3>

<p>The build configuration files that allow cross-building of the 32-bit
win32-x86-mingw cross-target have been adjusted to default to building shared
libraries (DLLs) as this is now supported by recent MinGW compilers. The 64-bit
windows-x64-mingw cross-target was already being built that way by default. The
configuration options to tell the minGW cross-compiler to link programs with
static versions of the compiler support libraries have now been moved into the
CONFIG_SITE.linux-x86.<i>target</i> files.</p>

<h3>General Time updates</h3>

<p>The <tt>iocInit</tt> code now performs a sanity check of the current time
returned by the generalTime subsystem and will print a warning if the wall-clock
time returned has not been initialized yet. This is just a warning message; when
a time provider does synchonize the IOC will subsequently pick up and use the
correct time. This check code also primes the registered event system provider
if there is one so the <tt>epicsTimeGetEventInt()</tt> routine will work on IOCs
that ask for event time within an interrupt service routine.</p>

<p>The osiClockTime provider's synchronization thread (which is only used on
some embedded targets) will now poll the other time providers at 1Hz until the
first time it manages to get a successful timestamp, after which it will poll
for updates every 60 seconds as before.</p>

<p>The routine <tt>generalTimeGetExceptPriority()</tt> was designed for use by
backup (lower priority) time providers like the osiClockTime provider which do
not have their own absolute time reference and rely on other providers for an
absolute time source. This routine no longer implements the ratchet mechanism
that prevented the time it returned from going backwards. If the backup clock's
tick-timer runs fast the synchronization of the backup time provider would never
allow it to be corrected backwards when the ratchet was in place. The regular
<tt>epicsTimeGetCurrent()</tt> API still uses the ratchet mechanism, so this
change will not cause the IOC to see time going backwards.</p>

<h3>Microsoft Visual Studio builds</h3>

<p>The build configuration files for builds using the Microsoft compilers have
been updated, although there should be no noticable difference at most sites.
One extra compiler warning is now being suppressed for C++ code, <tt>C4344:
behavior change: use of explicit template arguments results in ...</tt> which is
gratuitous and was appearing frequently in builds of the EPICS V4 modules.</p>

<p>Cross-builds of the windows-x64 target from a win32-x86 host have been
removed as they don't actually work within the context of a single <tt>make</tt>
run. Significant changes to the build configuration files would be necessary for
these kinds of cross-builds to work properly, which could be done if someone
needs them (email Andrew Johnson before working on this, and see
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5807647/how-do-you-compile-32-bit-and-64-bit-applications-at-the-same-time-in-visual-stu">
this stack-overflow answer</a> for a starting point).</p>

<h3>Bazaar keywords such as 'Revision-Id' removed</h3>

<p>In preparation for moving to git in place of the Bazaar revision control
system we have removed all the keywords from the Base source code.</p>

<h3>Linux systemd service file for CA Repeater</h3>

<p>Building this version of Base on a Linux system creates a systemd service
file suitable for starting the Channel Access Repeater under systemd. The file
will be installed into the target bin directory, from where it can be copied
into the appropriate systemd location and modified as necessary. Installation
instructions are included as comments in the file.</p>


<h2 align="center">Changes made between 3.15.3 and 3.15.4</h2>

<h3>New string input device support "getenv"</h3>

<p>A new "getenv" device support for both the stringin and lsi (long string
input) record types can be used to read the value of an environment variable
from the IOC at runtime. See base/db/softIocExit.db for sample usage.</p>

<h3>Build rules and DELAY_INSTALL_LIBS</h3>

<p>A new order-only prerequisite build rule has been added to ensure that
library files (and DLL stubs on Windows) get installed before linking any
executables, which resolves parallel build problems on high-powered CPUs. There
are some (rare) cases though where a Makefile has to build an executable and run
it to be able to compile code for a library built by the same Makefile. With
this new build rule GNUmake will complain about a circular dependency and the
build will probably fail in those cases. To avoid this problem the failing
Makefile should set <tt>DELAY_INSTALL_LIBS = YES</tt> before including the
<tt>$(TOP)/configure/RULES</tt> file, disabling the new build rule.</p>

<h3>IOC environment variables and build parameters</h3>

<p>The IOC now sets a number of environment variables at startup that provide
the version of EPICS Base it was built against (EPICS_VERSION_...) and its build
architecture (ARCH). In some cases this allows a single iocBoot/ioc directory to
be used to run the same IOC on several different architectures without any
changes.</p>

<p>There are also 3 new environment parameters (EPICS_BUILD_...) available that
C/C++ code can use to find out the target architecture, OS class and compiler
class it was built with. These may be useful when writing interfaces to other
languages.</p>

<h3>New implementation of promptgroup/gui_group field property</h3>

<p>The mechanism behind the "promptgroup()" field property inside a record type
definition has been changed. Instead of using a fixed set of choices,
the static database access library now collects the used gui group names
while parsing DBD information. Group names should start with a two-digit number
plus space-dash-space to allow proper sorting of groups.</p>

<p>The include file <tt>guigroup.h</tt> that defined the fixed set of choices
has been deprecated. Instead, use the conversion functions between index number
and group string that have been added to dbStaticLib.</p>

<p>When a DBD file containing record-type descriptions is expanded, any
old-style <tt>GUI_xxx</tt> group names will be replaced by a new-style
string for use by the IOC. This permits an older record type to be used with
the 3.15.4 release, although eventually record types should be converted by
hand with better group names used.</p>

<h3>CA server configuration changes</h3>

<p>RSRV now honors EPICS_CAS_INTF_ADDR_LIST and binds only to the provided list
of network interfaces. Name searches (UDP and TCP) on other network interfaces
are ignored. For example on a computer with interfaces 10.5.1.1/24, 10.5.2.1/24,
and 10.5.3.1/24, setting "EPICS_CAS_INTF_ADDR_LIST='10.5.1.1 10.5.2.1'" will
accept traffic on the .1.1 and .2.1, but ignore from .3.1</p>

<p>RSRV now honors EPICS_CAS_IGNORE_ADDR_LIST and ignores UDP messages received
from addresses in this list.</p>

<p>Previously, CA servers (RSRV and PCAS) would build the beacon address list
using EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST if EPICS_CAS_BEACON_ADDR_LIST was no set. This is no
longer done. Sites depending on this should set both envronment variables to the
same value.</p>

<h3>IPv4 multicast for name search and beacons</h3>

<p>libca, RSRV, and PCAS may now use IPv4 multicasting for UDP traffic (name
search and beacons). This is disabled by default. To enable multicast address(s)
must be listed in EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST for clients and EPICS_CAS_INTF_ADDR_LIST
for servers (IOCs should set both). For example:
"EPICS_CAS_INTF_ADDR_LIST='224.0.2.9' EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST=224.0.2.9".</p>

<p>Please note that no IPv4 multicast address is officially assigned for Channel
Access by IANA. The example 224.0.2.9 is taken from the AD-HOC Block I range.<p>

<h3>Moved <tt>mlockall()</tt> into its own epicsThread routine</h3>

<p>Since EPICS Base 3.15.0.2 on Posix OSs the initialization of the epicsThread
subsystem has called <tt>mlockall()</tt> when the OS supports it and thread
priority scheduling is enabled. Doing so has caused problems in third-party
applications that call the CA client library, so the functionality has been
moved to a separate routine <tt>epicsThreadRealtimeLock()</tt> which will be
called by the IOC at iocInit (unless disabled by setting the global variable
<tt>dbThreadRealtimeLock</tt> to zero).</p>

<h3>Added dbQuietMacroWarnings control</h3>

<p>When loading database files, macros get expanded even on comment lines. If a
comment contains an undefined macro, the load still continues but an error
message gets printed. For this release the error message has been changed to a
warning, but even this warning can be made less verbose by setting this new
variable to a non-zero value before loading the file, like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
var dbQuietMacroWarnings 1      <i>iocsh</i>
dbQuietMacroWarnings=1          <i>VxWorks</i>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This was <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/541119">Launchpad bug
541119</a>.</p>


<h2 align="center">Changes from the 3.14 branch between 3.15.3 and 3.15.4</h2>

<h3>NTP Time Provider adjusts to OS tick rate changes</h3>

<p>Dirk Zimoch provided code that allows the NTP Time provider (used on VxWorks
and RTEMS only) to adapt to changes in the OS clock tick rate after the provider
has been initialized. Note that changing the tick rate after iocInit() is not
advisable, and that other software might still misbehave if initialized before
an OS tick rate change. This change was back-ported from the 3.15 branch.</p>

<h3>Making IOC ca_get operations atomic</h3>

<p>When a CA client gets data from an IOC record using a compound data type such
as <tt>DBR_TIME_DOUBLE</tt> the value field is fetched from the database in a
separate call than the other metadata, without keeping the record locked. This
allows some other thread such as a periodic scan thread a chance to interrupt
the get operation and process the record in between. CA monitors have always
been atomic as long as the value data isn't a string or an array, but this race
condition in the CA get path has now been fixed so the record will stay locked
between the two fetch operations.</p>

<p>This fixes <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/epics-base/+bug/1581212">
Launchpad bug #1581212</a>, thanks to Till Strauman and Dehong Zhang.</p>

<h3>New CONFIG_SITE variable for running self-tests</h3>

<p>The 'make runtests' and 'make tapfiles' build targets normally only run the
self-tests for the main <tt>EPICS_HOST_ARCH</tt> architecture. If the host is
able to execute self-test programs for other target architectures that are being
built by the host, such as when building a <tt>-debug</tt> version of the host
architecture for example, the names of those other architectures can be added to
the new <tt>CROSS_COMPILER_RUNTEST_ARCHS</tt> variable in either the
<tt>configure/CONFIG_SITE</tt> file or in an appropriate
<tt>configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.&lt;host&gt;.Common</tt> file to have the test
programs for those targets be run as well.</p>

<h3>Additional RELEASE file checks</h3>

<p>An additional check has been added at build-time for the contents of the
configure/RELEASE file(s), which will mostly only affect users of the Debian
EPICS packages published by NSLS-2. Support modules may share an install path,
but all such modules must be listed adjacent to each other in any RELEASE files
that point to them. For example the following will fail the new checks:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
AUTOSAVE = /usr/lib/epics
ASYN = /home/mdavidsaver/asyn
EPICS_BASE = /usr/lib/epics
</pre></blockquote>

<p>giving the compile-time error</p>

<blockquote><pre>
This application's RELEASE file(s) define
	EPICS_BASE = /usr/lib/epics
after but not adjacent to
	AUTOSAVE = /usr/lib/epics
Module definitions that share paths must be grouped together.
Either remove a definition, or move it to a line immediately
above or below the other(s).
Any non-module definitions belong in configure/CONFIG_SITE.
</pre></blockquote>


<p>In many cases such as the one above the order of the <tt>AUTOSAVE</tt> and
<tt>ASYN</tt> lines can be swapped to let the checks pass, but if the
<tt>AUTOSAVE</tt> module depended on <tt>ASYN</tt> and hence had to appear
before it in the list this error indicates that <tt>AUTOSAVE</tt> should also be
built in its own private area; a shared copy would likely be incompatible with
the version of <tt>ASYN</tt> built in the home directory.</p>

<h3>String field buffer overflows</h3>

<p>Two buffer overflow bugs that can crash the IOC have been fixed, caused by
initializing a string field with a value larger than the field size
(<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1563191">Launchpad bug
#1563191</a>).</p>

<h3>Fixed stack corruption bug in epicsThread C++ API</h3>

<p>The C++ interface to the epicsThread API could corrupt the stack on thread
exit in some rare circumstances, usually at program exit. This bug has been
fixed (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1558206">Launchpad bug
#1558206</a>).</p>

<h3>RTEMS NTP Support Issue</h3>

<p>On RTEMS the NTP Time Provider could in some circumstances get out of sync
with the server because the osdNTPGet() code wasn't clearing its input socket
before sending out a new request. This
(<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1549908">Launchpad bug 1549908</a>)
has now been fixed.</p>

<h3>CALC engine bitwise operator fixes</h3>

<p>The bitwise operators in the CALC engine have been modified to work properly
with values that have bit 31 (0x80000000) set. This modification involved
back-porting some earlier changes from the 3.15 branch, and fixes
<a href="https://code.launchpad.net/bugs/1514520">Launchpad bug
#1514520</a>.</p>

<h3>Fix <tt>ipAddrToAsciiAsync()</tt>: Don't try to join the daemon thread</h3>

<p>On process exit, don't try to stop the worker thread that makes DNS lookups
asynchronous. Previously this would wait for any lookups still in progress,
delaying the exit unnecessarily. This was most obvious with catools (eg.
cainfo).
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1527636">lp:1527636</a></p>

<h3>Fix <tt>epicsTime_localtime()</tt> on Windows</h3>

<p>Simpler versions of the epicsTime_gmtime() and epicsTime_localtime()
routines have been included in the Windows implementations, and a new test
program added. The original versions do not report DST status properly. Fixes
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1528284">Launchpad bug 1528284</a>.</p>
