 * the trailing nil byte in the input expression string. The actual size
 * needed is never larger than this value, although it is actually a

/** \brief Compile an infix expression into postfix byte-code
 *
 * Converts an expression from an infix string to postfix byte-code
 *
 * \param pinfix Pointer to the infix string
 * \param ppostfix Pointer to the postfix buffer
 * \param perror Place to return an error code
 * \return Non-zero value in event of error
 *
 * It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that \c ppostfix points
 * to sufficient storage to hold the postfix expression. The macro
 * INFIX_TO_POSTFIX_SIZE(n) can be used to calculate an appropriate
 * postfix buffer size from the length of the infix buffer.
 *
 * \note "n" must count the terminating nil byte too.
 *
 * -# The **infix expressions** that can be used are very similar
 * to the C expression syntax, but with some additions and subtle
 * differences in operator meaning and precedence. The string may
 * contain a series of expressions separated by a semi-colon character ';'
 * any one of which may actually provide the calculation result; however
 * all of the other expressions included must assign their result to
 * a variable. All alphabetic elements described below are case independent,
 * so upper and lower case letters may be used and mixed in the variable
 * and function names as desired. Spaces may be used anywhere within an
 * expression except between the characters that make up a single expression element.
 *
 * -# ***Numeric Literals***
 *  The simplest expression element is a numeric literal, any (positive)
 *  number expressed using the standard floating point syntax that can be stored
 *  as a double precision value. This now includes the values Infinity and
 *  NaN (not a number). Note that negative numbers will be encoded as a
 *  positive literal to which the unary negate operator is applied.
 *
 *  - Examples:
 *    - 1
 *    - 2.718281828459
 *    - Inf
 *
 * -# ***Constants***
 *  There are three trigonometric constants available to any expression
 *  which return a value:
 *    - pi returns the value of the mathematical constant pi.
 *    - D2R evaluates to pi/180 which, when used as a multiplier,
 *    converts an angle from degrees to radians.
 *    - R2D evaluates to 180/pi which as a multiplier converts an angle
 *    from radians to degrees.
 *
 * -# ***Variables***
 *  Variables are used to provide inputs to an expression, and are named
 *  using the single letters A through L inclusive or the keyword VAL which
 *  refers to the previous result of this calculation. The software that
 *  makes use of the expression evaluation code should document how the
 *  individual variables are given values; for the calc record type the input
 *  links INPA through INPL can be used to obtain these from other record fields,
 *  and VAL refers to the the VAL field (which can be overwritten from outside
 *  the record via Channel Access or a database link).
 *
 * -# ***Variable Assignment Operator***
 *  Recently added is the ability to assign the result of a sub-expression to
 *  any of the single letter variables, which can then be used in another
 *  sub-expression. The variable assignment operator is the character pair
 *  := and must immediately follow the name of the variable to receive the
 *  expression value. Since the infix string must return exactly one value, every
 *  expression string must have exactly one sub-expression that is not an
 *  assignment, which can appear anywhere in the string. Sub-expressions within
 *  the string are separated by a semi-colon character.
 *
 *    - Examples:
 *      - B; B:=A
 *      - i:=i+1; a*sin(i*D2R)
 *
 * -# ***Arithmetic Operators***
 *  The usual binary arithmetic operators are provided: + - * and / with their
 *  usual relative precedence and left-to-right associativity, and - may also
 *  be used as a unary negate operator where it has a higher precedence and
 *  associates from right to left. There is no unary plus operator, so numeric
 *  literals cannot begin with a + sign.
 *
 *    - Examples:
 *      - a*b + c
 *      - a/-4 - b
 *
 *  Three other binary operators are also provided: % is the integer modulo operator,
 *  while the synonymous operators ** and ^ raise their left operand to the power of
 *  the right operand. % has the same precedence and associativity as * and /, while
 *  the power operators associate left-to-right and have a precedence in between * and
 *  unary minus.
 *
 *    - Examples:
 *      - e:=a%10;
 *      - d:=a/10%10;
 *      - c:=a/100%10;
 *      - b:=a/1000%10;
 *      - b*4096+c*256+d*16+e
 *      - sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
 *
 * -# ***Algebraic Functions***
 *  Various algebraic functions are available which take parameters inside
 *  parentheses. The parameter separator is a comma.
 *
 *    - Absolute value: abs(a)
 *    - Exponential ea: exp(a)
 *    - Logarithm, base 10: log(a)
 *    - Natural logarithm (base e): ln(a) or loge(a)
 *    - n parameter maximum value: max(a, b, ...)
 *    - n parameter minimum value: min(a, b, ...)
 *    - Square root: sqr(a) or sqrt(a)
 *
 * -# ***Trigonometric Functions***
 *  Standard circular trigonometric functions, with angles expressed in radians:
 *    - Sine: sin(a)
 *    - Cosine: cos(a)
 *    - Tangent: tan(a)
 *    - Arcsine: asin(a)
 *    - Arccosine: acos(a)
 *    - Arctangent: atan(a)
 *    - 2 parameter arctangent: atan2(a, b)
 *  \note  Note that these arguments are the reverse of the ANSI C function,
 *  so while C would return arctan(a/b) the calc expression engine returns arctan(b/a)
 *
 * -# ***Hyperbolic Trigonometry***
 *  The basic hyperbolic functions are provided, but no inverse functions
 *  (which are not provided by the ANSI C math library either).
 *     - Hyperbolic sine: sinh(a)
 *     - Hyperbolic cosine: cosh(a)
 *     - Hyperbolic tangent: tanh(a)
 *
 * -# ***Numeric Functions***
 *  The numeric functions perform operations related to the floating point
 *  numeric representation and truncation or rounding.
 *    - Round up to next integer: ceil(a)
 *    - Round down to next integer: floor(a)
 *    - Round to nearest integer: nint(a)
 *    - Test for infinite result: isinf(a)
 *    - Test for any non-numeric values: isnan(a, ...)
 *    - Test for all finite, numeric values: finite(a, ...)
 *    - Random number between 0 and 1: rndm
 *
 * -# ***Boolean Operators***
 *  These operators regard their arguments as true or false, where 0.0 is
 *  false and any other value is true.
 *
 *    - Boolean and: a && b
 *    - Boolean or: a || b
 *    - Boolean not: !a
 *
 * -# ***Bitwise Operators***
 * The bitwise operators convert their arguments to an integer (by truncation),
 * perform the appropriate bitwise operation and convert back to a floating point
 * value. Unlike in C though, ^ is not a bitwise exclusive-or operator.
 *
 *    - Bitwise and: a & b or a and b
 *    - Bitwise or: a | b or a or b
 *    - Bitwise exclusive or: a xor b
 *    - Bitwise not (ones complement): ~a or not a
 *    - Bitwise left shift: a << b
 *    - Bitwise right shift: a >> b
 *
 * -# ***Relational Operators***
 *  Standard numeric comparisons between two values:
 *
 *    - Less than: a < b
 *    - Less than or equal to: a <= b
 *    - Equal to: a = b or a == b
 *    - Greater than or equal to: a >= b
 *    - Greater than: a > b
 *    - Not equal to: a != b or a # b
 *
 * -# ***Conditional Operator***
 *  Expressions can use the C conditional operator, which has a lower
 *  precedence than all of the other operators except for the assignment operator.
 *
 *    - condition ? true result : false result
 *      - Example:
 *        - a < 360 ? a+1 : 0
 *
 * -# ***Parentheses***
 * Sub-expressions can be placed within parentheses to override operator presence rules.
 * Parentheses can be nested to any depth, but the intermediate value stack used by
 * the expression evaluation engine is limited to 80 results (which require an
 * expression at least 321 characters long to reach).
