<h1>EPICS Base Release Procedures &amp; Checklist</h1>

<p>This document describes the procedures and provides a checklist of tasks
that should be performed when creating production releases of EPICS Base.</p>

<h3>The Release Process</h3>

<h4>Full Process</h4>

<p>The version released on the Feature Freeze date is designated the first
pre-release, <tt>-pre1</tt>. The first release candidate <tt>-rc1</tt> is the
first version that has undergone testing by the developers and has shown no
problems that must be fixed before release. New versions should be made at about
2-weekly intervals after the <tt>-pre1</tt> release, and designated as either
pre-release or release candidate versions by the Release Manager. Release
candidates are announced to the whole community via the tech-talk mailing list,
pre-releases are announced to to the developers via the core-talk list. After a
release candidate has been available for 2 weeks without any new problems being
reported or major changes having to be committed, the final release can be
made.</p>

<h4>Short Process for Patch Releases</h4>

<p>The Patch Release date and its scope are agreed upon a few weeks ahead of the
release. If no blocking issues are raised, the release is made by the Release
Manager on or as soon as possible after that date, following the steps below
starting at <a href="#ReleaseApproval">Release Approval</a>.</p>

<h3>Roles</h3>

<p>The following roles are used below:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Release Manager</strong> ()</dt>
    <dd>Responsible for managing and tagging the release</dd>
  <dt><strong>Platform Developers</strong> (optional)</dt>
    <dd>Responsible for individual operating system platforms</dd>
  <dt><strong>Application Developers</strong></dt>
    <dd>Responsible for support modules that depend on EPICS Base.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Website Manager</strong> (Andrew Johnson)</dt>
    <dd>Responsible for the EPICS website</dd>
