# Host/target specific settings can be specified in files named

# CHECK_RELEASE controls the consistency checking of the support
#   applications pointed to by the RELEASE* files.
# Normally CHECK_RELEASE should be set to YES.
# Set CHECK_RELEASE to NO to disable checking completely.
# Set CHECK_RELEASE to WARN to perform consistency checking but
#   continue building even if conflicts are found.
CHECK_RELEASE = YES

# Set this when you only want to compile this application
#   for a subset of the cross-compiled target architectures
#   that Base is built for.
#CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS = vxWorks-ppc32

# To install files into a location other than $(TOP) define
#   INSTALL_LOCATION here.
#INSTALL_LOCATION=</absolute/path/to/install/top>

# Set this when the IOC and build host use different paths
#   to the install location. This may be needed to boot from
#   a Microsoft FTP server say, or on some NFS configurations.
#IOCS_APPL_TOP = </IOC's/absolute/path/to/install/top>

#   or CROSS_OPT settings from base/configure/CONFIG_SITE
#HOST_OPT = NO
#CROSS_OPT = NO

# These allow developers to override the CONFIG_SITE variable
# settings without having to modify the configure/CONFIG_SITE
# file itself.
