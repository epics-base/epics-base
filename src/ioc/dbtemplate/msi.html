<h1>msi: Macro Substitution and Include Tool</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>msi is a general purpose macro substitution/include tool. It accepts as input
an ascii template file. It looks for lines containing two reserved command
names: <tt>include</tt> and <tt>substitute</tt>. It also looks for and performs
substitutions on macros of the form $(var) and ${var}. It uses the macLib
routines from EPICS Base to perform the substitutions, so it also accepts the
default value and value definition syntax that macLib implements.</p>

<p>msi also allows substitutions to be specified via a separate substitution
file. This substitution file allows the same format as the substitution files
accepted by the EPICS IOC's dbLoadTemplate command.</p>

<h2>Command Syntax:</h2>

<pre>msi -V -g -D -o<i>outfile</i> -I<i>dir</i> -M<i>subs</i> -S<i>subfile</i> <i>template</i></pre>

<p>All parameters are optional. The -o, -I, -M, and -S switches may be
separated from their associated value string by spaces if desired. Output will
be written to stdout unless the -o option is given.</p>

<p>Switches have the following meanings:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>-V</tt></dt>
    <dd>Verbose warnings; if this parameter is specified then any undefined
    macro discovered in the template file which does not have an associated
    default value is considered an error. An error message is generated, and
    when msi terminates it will do so with an exit status of 2.</dd>

  <dt><tt>-g</tt></dt>
    <dd>When this flag is given all macros defined in a substitution file will
    have global scope and thus their values will persist until a new value is
    given for this macro. This flag is provided for backwards compatibility as
    this was the behavior of previous versions of msi, but it does not follow
    common scoping rules and is discouraged.</dd>

  <dt><tt>-D</tt></dt>
    <dd>Output dependency information suitable for including by a Makefile to
    stdout instead of performing the macro substitutions. The <tt>-o</tt> option
    must be given to specify the target name for the dependency rules. Other
    options should be given exactly as will be used in the macro substitution
    process.</dd>

  <dt><tt>-o</tt> <i>file</i></dt>
    <dd>Output will be written to the specifed file rather than to the standard
    output.</dd>

  <dt><tt>-I</tt> <i>dir</i></dt>
    <dd>This parameter, which may be repeated or contain a colon-separated (or
    semi-colon separated on Windows) list of directory paths, specifies a search
    path for include commands. For example:

    <blockquote>
    <pre>msi -I /home/mrk/examples:. -I.. template</pre>
    </blockquote>

    specifies that all named files should be searched for in the following
    locations in the order given:

    <ol>
      <li><tt>/home/mrk/examples</tt></li>
      <li><tt>.</tt> (the current directory)</li>
      <li><tt>..</tt> (the parent of the current directory)</li>
    </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>-M</tt> <i>substitutions</i></dt>
    <dd>This parameter specifies macro values for the template instance.
    Multiple macro values can be specified in one substitution parameter, or in
    multiple <tt>-M</tt> parameters. For example:

    <blockquote>
    <pre>msi -M "a=aval,b=bval" -Mc=cval template</pre>
    </blockquote>

    specifies that in the template file each occurrence of:

    <dl>
      <dd><tt>$(a)</tt> or <tt>${a}</tt> is replaced by <tt>aval</tt></dd>
      <dd><tt>$(b)</tt> or <tt>${b}</tt> is replaced by <tt>bval</tt></dd>
      <dd><tt>$(c)</tt> or <tt>${c}</tt> is replaced by <tt>cval</tt></dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>-S</tt> <i>subfile</i></dt>
    <dd>The substitution file. See below for format.</dd>

  <dt><i>template</i></dt>
    <dd> The input file. If no file is specified then input is taken from
    stdin, i.e. msi can be used as a filter. See below for a description of
    commands that can be embedded in the template file.</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is not possible to display usage by just typing <tt>msi</tt> since
executing the command with no arguments is a valid command. To show usage
specify an illegal switch, e.g.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>msi -help</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Exit Status</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>0<dd>Success.
  <dt>1<dd>Can't open/create file, or other I/O error.
  <dt>2<dd>Undefined macros encountered with the <tt>-V</tt> option specified.
</dl>

<h2>Template File Format</h2>

<p>This file contains the text to be read and written to the output after macro
substitution is performed. If no file is given then input is read from stdin.
Variable instances to be substituted by macro values are expressed in the
template using the syntax <tt>$(</tt><i>name</i><tt>)</tt> or
<tt>${</tt><i>name</i><tt>}</tt>. The template can also provide default values
to be used when a macro has not been given a value, using the syntax
<tt>$(</tt><i>name</i><tt>=</tt><i>default</i><tt>)</tt> or
<tt>${</tt><i>name</i><tt>=</tt><i>default</i><tt>}</tt>.</p>

<p>For example, using the command</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>msi -M name=Marty template</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>where the file template contains</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>My name is $(name)
My age is $(age=none of your business)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>results in this output:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>My name is Marty
My age is none of your business</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Macro variables and their default values can be expressed in terms of other
macros if necessary, to almost any level of complexity. Recursive definitions
will generate warning messages on stderr and result in undefined output.</p>

<p>The template file is read and processed one line at a time, where the
maximum length of a line before and/or after macro expansion is 1023 characters
&mdash; longer input or output lines will cause msi to fail. Within the context
of a single line, macro expansion does not occur when the variable instance
appears inside a single-quoted string, or where the dollar sign <tt>$</tt> is
preceded by a back-slash character <tt>\</tt>, but as with the standard Unix
shells, variables inside double quoted strings are expanded properly.</p>

<p>However neither back-slash characters nor quotes of either variety are
removed when generating the output file, so depending on what is being output
the single quote behaviour may not be useful and may even be a hinderance. It
cannot be disabled in the current version of msi.</p>

<h3>Template file commands</h3>

<p>In addition to the regular text and variable instances described above, the
template file may also contain commands which allow the insertion of other
template files and the ability to set macro values inside the template file
itself. These commands are:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>include "file"
substitute "var=value,var=value,..."</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Lines containing commands must be in one of these forms:</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>include "</tt><i>filename</i><tt>"</tt></li>
  <li><tt>substitute "</tt><i>name1=value1, name2=value2, ...</i><tt>"</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>White space is allowed before and after the command verb, and after the
quoted string. If embedded quotes are needed, the backslash character
<tt>\</tt> can be used as an escape character. For example</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>substitute "a=\"val\""</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>specifies that (unless <tt>a</tt> is subsequently redefined) wherever a
<tt>$(a)</tt> macro appears in the template below this point, the text
<tt>"val"</tt> (including the double quote characters) will appear in the
output instead.</p>

<p>If a line does match either syntax above it is just passed to macLib for
processing without any notification. Thus the input line:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>include "myfile" #include file</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>would just be passed to macLib, i.e. it would <em>not</em> be considered an
include command.</p>

<p>As an example of these commands, let the Unix command be:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>msi template</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and file includeFile contain:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>first name is ${first}
family name is ${family}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and template is</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>substitute "first=Marty,family=Kraimer"
include "includeFile"
substitute "first=Irma,family=Kraimer"
include "includeFile"</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>then the following is written to the output.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>first name is Marty
family name is Kraimer
first name is Irma
family name is Kraimer</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that the IOC's <tt>dbLoadTemplate</tt> command does not support the
<tt>substitute</tt> syntax in template files, although the <tt>include</tt>
syntax is supported.</p>

<h2>Substitution File Format</h2>

<p>The optional substitution file has three formats: regular, pattern, and
dbTemplate format. We will discuss each separately.</p>

<h3>Regular format</h3>

<blockquote>
<pre>global {gbl_var1=gbl_val1, gbl_var2=gbl_val2, ...}
{var1=set1_val1, var2=set1_val2, ...}
{var2=set2_val2, var1=set2_val1, ...}
global {gbl_var1=gbl_val3, gbl_var2=gbl_val4, ...}
{var1=set3_val1, var2=set3_val2, ...}
{var2=set4_val2, var1=set4_val1, ...}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The template file is output with macro substitutions performed once for each
set of braces containing macro replacement values.</p> 

<h3>Pattern format</h3>

<blockquote>
<pre>global {gbl_var1=gbl_val1, gbl_var2=gbl_val2, ...}
pattern {var1, var2, ...}
{set1_val1, set1_val2, ...}
{set2_val1, set2_val2, ...}
pattern {var2, var1, ...}
global {gbl_var1=gbl_val3, gbl_var2=gbl_val4, ...}
{set3_val2, set3_val1, ...}
{set4_val2, set4_val2, ...}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This produces the same result as the regular format example above.</p>

<h3>dbLoadTemplate Format</h3>

<p>This format is an extension of the format accepted by the EPICS IOC command
<tt>dbLoadTemplate</tt>, and allows templates to be expanded on the host rather
by using dbLoadTemplate at IOC boot time.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>global {gbl_var1=gbl_val1, gbl_var2=gbl_val2, ...}
file templatefile {
    <i>pattern format or regular format</i>
}
file "${WHERE}/template2" {
    <i>pattern format or regular format</i>
}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>For the dbTemplate format, the template filename does not have to be given
on the command line, and is usually specified in the substitutions file
instead. If a template filename is given on the command line it will override
the filenames listed in the substitutions files.</p>

<h3>Syntax for all formats</h3>

<p>A comment line may appear anywhere in a substitution file, and will be
ignored. A comment line is any line beginning with the character <tt>#</tt>,
which must be the very first character on the line.</p>

<p>Global definitions may supplement or override the macro values supplied on
the command-line using the <tt>-M</tt> switch, and set default values that will
survive for the remainder of the file unless another global definition of the
same macro changes it.</p>

<p>For definitions within braces given in any of the file formats, a separator
must be given between items. A separator is either a comma, or one or more of
the standard white space characters (space, formfeed, newline, carriage return,
tab or vertical tab).</p>

<p>Each item within braces can be an alphanumeric token, or a double-quoted
string. A back-slash character <tt>\</tt> can be used to escape a quote
character needed inside a quoted string. These three sets of substitutions are
all equivalent:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>{a=aa b=bb c="\"cc\""}
{b="bb",a=aa,c="\"cc\""}
{
    c="\"cc\""
    b=bb
    a="aa"
}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Within a substitutions file, the file name may appear inside double quotation
marks; these are required if the name contains certain characters or environment
variable macros of the form ${ENV_VAR} or $(ENV_VAR), which will be expanded
before the file is opened.</p>

<h3>Regular substitution example</h3>

<p>Let the command be:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>msi -S substitute template</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The file <tt>template</tt> contains</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>first name is ${first}
family name is ${family}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> and the file <tt>substitute</tt> is</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>global {family=Kraimer}
{first=Marty}
{first=Irma}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The following is the output produced:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>first name is Marty
family name is Kraimer
first name is Irma
family name is Kraimer</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Pattern substitution example</h3>

<p>Let the command be:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>msi -S pattern template</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The file <tt>pattern</tt> contains</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>pattern {first,last}
{Marty,Kraimer}
{Irma,Kraimer}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and <tt>template</tt> is the same as the previous example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>first name is ${first}
family name is ${family}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the output:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>first name is Marty
family name is Kraimer
first name is Irma
family name is Kraimer</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>dbTemplate example</h3>
Let the command be

<blockquote>
<pre>msi -S xxx.substitutions</pre>
</blockquote>

<tt>xxx.substitutions</tt> is

<blockquote>
<pre>file template {
pattern {first,last}
{Marty,Kraimer}
{Irma,Kraimer}
pattern {last,first}
{Smith,Bill}
{Smith,Mary}
}
file template {
{first=Marty,last=Kraimer}
{first=Irma,last=Kraimer}
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<tt>template</tt> is the same as in the previous example..

<p>The following is written to the output</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>first name is Marty
family name is Kraimer
first name is Irma
family name is Kraimer
first name is Bill
last name is Smith
first name is Mary
last name is Smith
first name is Marty
family name is Kraimer
first name is Irma
family name is Kraimer</pre>
</blockquote>
