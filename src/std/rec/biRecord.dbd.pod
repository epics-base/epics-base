=title Binary Input Record (bi)

This record type is normally used to obtain a binary value of 0 or 1. Most
device support modules obtain values from hardware and place the value in
RVAL. For these devices, record processing sets VAL = (0,1) if RVAL is (0,
not 0). Device support modules may optionally read a value directly from
VAL.

Soft device modules are provided to obtain input via database or channel
access links via dbPutField or dbPutLink requests. Two soft device support
modules are provided: C<Soft Channel> and C<Raw Soft Channel>. The first
allows VAL to be an arbitrary unsigned short integer. The second reads the
value into RVAL just like normal hardware modules.

=head2 Parameter Fields

The binary input's fields fall into the following categories:

=over

=item *
scan Parameters

=item *
read and convert parameters

=item *
operator display parameters

=item *
alarm parameters

=item *
run-time parameters

=recordtype bi

recordtype(bi) {

=head3 Scan Parameters

The binary input record has the standard fields for specifying under what
circumstances the record will be processed. These fields are listed in
L<Scan Fields>. In addition, L<Scanning Specification> explains how these
fields are used. Note that I/O event scanning is only supported for those
card types that interrupt.

=fields SCAN

=head3 Read and Convert Parameters

The read and convert fields determine where the binary input gets its
input from and how to convert the raw signal to engineering units. The INP
field contains the address from where device support retrieves the value.
If the binary input record gets its value from hardware, the address of the
card must be entered in the INP field, and the name of the device support
module must be entered in the DTYP field. See L<Address Specification> for
information on the format of the hardware address. Be aware that the format
differs between types of cards.

For records that specify C<Soft Channel> or C<Raw Soft Channel> device
support routines, the INP field can be a channel or a database link, or a
constant. If a constant, VAL can be changed directly by dbPuts. See
L<Address Specification> for information on the format of database and
channel access addresses. Also, see L<Device Support for Soft Records> in
this chapter for information on soft device support.

If the record gets its values from hardware or uses the C<Raw Soft Channel>
device support, the device support routines place the value in the RVAL
field which is then converted using the process described in the next
section.

=fields INP, DTYP, ZNAM, ONAM, RVAL, VAL

=head3 Conversion Fields

The VAL field is set equal to (0,1) if the RVAL field is (0, not 0), unless
the device support module reads a value directly into VAL or the
C<Soft Channel> device support is used. The value can also be fetched as one of
the strings specified in the ZNAM or ONAM fields. The ZNAM field has a
string that corresponds to the 0 state, so when the value is fetched as
this string, C<put_enum_str()> will return a 0. The ONAM field hold the
string that corresponds to the 1 state, so when the value is fetched as
this string, C<put_enum_str()> returns a 1.

=fields ZNAM, ONAM

=head3 Operator Display Parameters

These parameters are used to present meaningful data to the operator. The
C<get_enum_str()> record support routine can retrieve the state string
corresponding to the VAL's state. If the value is 1, C<get_enum_str()> will
return the string in the ONAM field; and if 0, C<get_enum_str()> will return
the ZNAM string.

See L<Fields Common to All Record Types> for more on the record name (NAME)
and description (DESC) fields.

=fields ZNAM, ONAM, NAME, DESC

=head3 Alarm Parameters

These parameters are used to determine if the binary input is in alarm
condition and to determine the severity of that condition. The possible
alarm conditions for binary inputs are the SCAN, READ state alarms, and the
change of state alarm. The SCAN and READ alarms are called by the device
supprt routines.

The user can choose the severity of each state in the ZSV and OSV fields.
The possible values for these fields are C<NO_ALARM>, C<MINOR>, and
C<MAJOR>. The ZSV field holds the severity for the zero state; OSV, for
the one state.  COSV causes an alarm whenever the state changes between
0 and 1 and the severity is configured as MINOR or MAJOR.

See L<Alarm Specification> for a complete explanation of the discrete alarm
states. L<Alarm Fields> lists other fields related to alarms that are
common to all record types.

=fields ZSV, OSV, COSV

=head3 Run-time Parameters and Simulation Mode Parameters

These parameters are used by the run-time code for processing the binary
input. They are not configured using a database configuration tool.

ORAW is used to determine if monitors should be triggered for RVAL at the same
time they are triggered for VAL.

MASK is given a value by ithe device support routines. This value is used to
manipulate the record's value, but is only the concern of the hardware device
support routines.

The LALM fields holds the value of the last occurence of the change of
state alarm. It is used to implement the change of state alarm, and thus
only has meaning if COSV is MAJOR or MINOR.

The MSLT field is used by the C<process()> record support routine to
determine if archive and value change monitors are invoked. They are if MSLT
is not equal to VAL.

=fields ORAW, MASK, LALM, MLST

The following fields are used to operate the binary input in simulation
mode. See L<Fields Common to Many Record Types> for more information on
these fields.

=fields SIOL, SVAL, SIML, SIMM, SIMS

=head2 Record Support

=head3 Record Support Routines

=head2 C<init_record>

This routine initializes SIMM with the value of SIML if SIML type is a
CONSTANT link or creates a channel access link if SIML type is PV_LINK.
SVAL is likewise initialized if SIOL is a CONSTANT or PV_LINK.

This routine next checks to see that device support is available and a
device support routine is defined. If neither exist, an error is issued and
processing is terminated.

If device support includes C<init_record()>, it is called.

=head2 C<process>

See next section.

=head2 C<get_enum_str>

Retrieves ASCII string corresponding to VAL.

=head2 C<get_enum_strs>

Retrieves ASCII strings for ZNAM and ONAM.

=head2 C<put_enum_str>

Check if string matches ZNAM or ONAM, and if it does, sets VAL.

=head2 Record Processing

Routine process implements the following algorithm:

=over 1

=item 1.
Check to see that the appropriate device support module exists. If it
doesn't, an error message is issued and processing is terminated with
the PACT field still set to TRUE. This ensures that processes will no
longer be called for this record. Thus error storms will not occur.

=item 2.
C<readValue()> is called. See L<Input Records> for details.

=item 3.
If PACT has been changed to TRUE, the device support read routine has
started but has not completed reading a new input value. In this case, the
processing routine merely returns, leaving PACT TRUE.

=item 4.
Convert.

=back

=over 1

=item *
status = read_bi

=item *
PACT = TRUE

=item *
C<recGblGetTimeStamp()> is called.

=item *
if status is 0, then set VAL=(0,1) if RVAL is (0, not 0) and UDF = False.

=item *
if status is 2, set status = 0

=back

=over 1

=item 5.
Check alarms: This routine checks to see if the new VAL causes the alarm
status and severity to change. If so, NSEV, NSTA and LALM are set. Note
that if VAL is greater than 1, no checking is performed.

=item 6.
Check if monitors should be invoked:

=back

=over 1

=item *
Alarm monitors are invoked if the alarm status or severity has changed.

=item *
Archive and value change monitors are invoked if MSLT is not equal to VAL.

=item *
Monitors for RVAL are checked whenever other monitors are invoked.

=item *
NSEV and NSTA are reset to 0.

=back

=over 1

=item 7.
Scan forward link if necessary, set PACT FALSE, and return.

=back

=head2 Device Support

=head3 Fields of Interest to Device Support

Each binary input record must have an associated set of device support
routines. The primary resposibility of the device support routines is to
obtain a new raw input value whenever C<read_bi()> is called. The device
support routines are primarily interested in the following fields:

=fields PACT, DPVT, UDF, NSEV, NSTA, VAL, INP, RVAL, MASK

=head3 Device Support routines

Device support consists of the following routines:

=head4 long report(int level)

This optional routine is called by the IOC command C<dbior> and is passed the
report level that was requested by the user.
It should print a report on the state of the device support to stdout.
The C<level> parameter may be used to output increasingly more detailed
information at higher levels, or to select different types of information with
different levels.
Level zero should print no more than a small summary.

=head4 long init(int after)

This optional routine is called twice at IOC initialization time.
The first call happens before any of the C<init_record()> calls are made, with
the integer parameter C<after> set to 0.
The second call happens after all of the C<init_record()> calls have been made,
with C<after> set to 1.

=head2 C<init_record(precord)>

This routine is optional. If provided, it is called by the record support
C<init_record()> routine.

=head2 C<get_ioint_info(int cmd, struct dbCommon *precord, IOSCANPVT *ppvt)>

This routine is called by the ioEventScan system each time the record is
added or deleted from an I/O event scan list. C<cmd> has the value (0,1) if
the record is being (added to, deleted from) and I/O event list. It must be
provided for any device type that can use the ioEvent scanner.

=head2 C<read_bi(precord)>

This routine must provide a new input value. It returns the following
values:

=over

=item 0:
Success. A new raw value is placed in RVAL. The record support module
forces VAL to be (0,1) if RVAL is (0, not 0).

=item 2:
Success, but don't modify VAL.

=item Other:
Error.

=back

=head3 Device Support for Soft Records

Two soft device support modules, Soft Channel and Raw Soft Channel, are
provided for input records not related to actual hardware devices. The INP
link type must be either CONSTANT, DB_LINK, or CA_LINK.

=head3 Soft Channel

C<read_bi()> always returns a value of 2, which means that no conversion is
performed.

If the INP link type is CONSTANT, then the constant value is stored in VAL
by C<init_record()>, and the UDF is set to FALSE. VAL can be changed via
C<dbPut()> requests. If the INP link type is PV_LINK, the C<dbCaAddInlink()> is
called by C<init_record()>.

C<read_bi()> calls C<dbGetLinkValue> to read the current value of VAL.
See L<Soft Input> for details.

If the return status of C<dbGetLinkValue()> is zero, then C<read_bi()> sets
UDF to FALSE. The status of C<dbGetLinkValue()> is returned.

=head3 Raw Soft Channel

This module is like the previous except that values are read into RVAL.

C<read_bi()> returns a value of 0. Thus the record processing routine will
force VAL to be 0 or 1.
