Status and to do of EPICS base:

- Channel Access:
   - Cannel name resolution:
     working: using link-local IPv6 addresses or global IPv6 addresses.
     todo: test with a DNS name (AAAA record)
   - beacons:
     Are send out via IPv6 link local addresses if configured
     with EPICS_CAS_AUTO_BEACON_ADDR_LIST=6 (or 46)
     The beacons use an extended message for CA_PROTO_RSRV_IS_UP
   - Revers name resolution
     aToIPAddr does not handle IPv6 (and needs to be replaced)
     Some problems to convert interface index into a name
     (The #%en0" part of the IPv6 address)
     Needs to be investigated (may be not thread-save ?)
   - Channel access via TCP/IPv6
     working
   - Mixed usage of IPv4 and IPv6 in the network:
     In general, this should work out of the box.
     Start the repeater like this:
     `killall caRepeater ; EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST=46 caRepeater`
     For IOCs and clients using IPv4, IPv6 or both see ipv6-howto.txt

- pvAccess:
   Nothing done yet.
   Probably we can steal/reuse code from channel access.
   However, I would like to see channel access more tested before starting
   with pvAccess
- Other modules:
  pcas:
    Work ongoing. Added patches so that pcas be compiled against latest base
    Support for IPv6 must be added.

- Linux, MacOs, Windows, vxWorks, RTEMS, BSD
  Testing on Linux and Mac looks good. Need to re-run FreeBSD.
  Windows: (Which "Windows" ? Visual Studio ? cygwin (seems obsolete) Mingw
  vxWorks, RTEMS: Testing needed.

- pyepics (with the latest ca library)
  First tests look good ("PYEPICS_LIBCA" is your friend)

- pvapy: to be done
- JCA: to be done
- EPICS gateways: to be done
-  asyn:
  Prototype working.
  It seems that asyn can support IPv6 independent of EPICS base,
  there is not really any common code.

Other todo (unorderedd)
- Clean up the debug printing
- More code review
- write automated tests
