# CONFIG_SITE.Common.linux-x86_64
#
# Site-specific settings for the linux-x86_64 target

# NOTE: In most cases if SHARED_LIBRARIES is set to YES the
# shared libraries will be found automatically.  However if the .so
# files are installed at a different path to their compile-time path
# then in order to be found at runtime do one of these:
# a) LD_LIBRARY_PATH must include the full absolute pathname to
#    $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH) when invoking base
#    executables.
# b) Add the runtime path to SHRLIB_DEPLIB_DIRS and PROD_DEPLIB_DIRS, which
#    will add the named directory to the list contained in the executables.
# c) Add the runtime path to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig
#    to inform the system of the shared library location.


# If libreadline needs additional libraries to be linked with it, try
# uncommenting each of the lines below in turn, starting with the top
# one and working downwards, until the build succeeds. Do a 'make rebuild'
# from the top of the Base tree after changing this setting.

# Needs -lncurses (RHEL 5 etc.):
#COMMANDLINE_LIBRARY = READLINE_NCURSES

# Needs -lcurses (older versions)
#COMMANDLINE_LIBRARY = READLINE_CURSES

# Readline is broken or you don't want use it:
#COMMANDLINE_LIBRARY = EPICS


# WARNING: Variables that are set in $(CONFIG)/CONFIG.gnuCommon cannot be
# overridden in this file for native builds, e.g. variables such as
#    OPT_CFLAGS_YES, WARN_CFLAGS, SHRLIB_LDFLAGS
# They must be set in CONFIG_SITE.linux-x86_64.linux-x86_64 instead.

# Tune GNU compiler output for a specific 64-bit cpu-type
# (e.g. generic, native, core2, nocona, k8, opteron, athlon64, barcelona etc.)
GNU_TUNE_CFLAGS = -mtune=generic

# Developers using a suitable compiler may enable its address sanitizer:
#ENABLE_ASAN = YES
