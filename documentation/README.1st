  What is EPICS base?

     The Experimental Physics and Industrial Control Systems (EPICS) is an
     extensible set of software components and tools with which application
     developers can create a control system. This control system can be used
     to control accelerators, detectors, telescopes, or other scientific
     experimental equipment. EPICS base is the set of core software, i.e. the
     components of EPICS without which EPICS would not function. EPICS base
     allows an arbitrary number of target systems, IOCs (input/output
     controllers), and host systems, OPIs (operator interfaces) of various
     types.

  Supported platforms

     The list of platforms supported by this version of EPICS base is given
     in the configure/CONFIG_SITE file. If you are trying to build EPICS Base
     on an unlisted host or for a different target machine you must have the
     proper host/target cross compiler and header files, and you will have to
     create and add the appropriate new configure files to the
     base/configure/os/directory. You can start by copying existing
     configuration files in the configure/os directory and then make changes
     for your new platforms.

  Supported compilers

     This version of EPICS base has been built and tested using the host
     vendor's C and C++ compilers, as well as the GNU gcc and g++ compilers.
     The GNU cross-compilers work for all cross-compiled targets. You may
     need the C and C++ compilers to be in your search path to do EPICS
     builds; check the definitions of CC and CCC in
     base/configure/os/CONFIG.<host>.<host> if you have problems.

  Software requirements

     GNU make
     You must use the GNU version of make for EPICS builds, and we now
     recommend version 4.1 or later (version 3.82 may work on Linux, but
     doesn't on Windows).

     Perl
     You must have Perl version 5.8.1 or later installed. The EPICS
     configuration files do not specify the perl full pathname, so the perl
     executable must be found through your normal search path.

     Unzip and tar (Winzip on WIN32 systems)
     You must have tools available to unzip and untar the EPICS base
     distribution file.

     Target systems
     EPICS supports IOCs running on embedded platforms such as VxWorks and
     RTEMS built using a cross-compiler, and also supports soft IOCs running
     as processes on the host platform.

     vxWorks
     You must have vxWorks 6 installed if any of your target systems are
     vxWorks systems; the C++ compilers for vxWorks 5.x are now too old to
     support. The vxWorks installation provides the cross-compiler and header
     files needed to build for these targets. The absolute path to and the
     version number of the vxWorks installation must be set in the
     base/configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.Common.vxWorksCommon file or in one of its
     target-specific overrides.

     Consult the vxWorks 6.x EPICS web pages and the vxWorks documentation
     for information about configuring your vxWorks operating system for use
     with EPICS.

     RTEMS
     For RTEMS targets, you need RTEMS core and toolset version 4.9.2 or
     4.10. The newer 4.11 or 5.x releases are not supported yet.

     Command-line editing libraries
     GNU readline or other OS-specific libraries can be used by the IOC shell
     to provide command line editing and history recall. The default setting
     is different for each OS. On Linux the default is to use READLINE since
     most distributions include it. On MacOS the default is also READLINE
     since Apple provides a compatible library, although it isn't GNU. On
     RTEMS we support GNU readline and Tecla, although the default is to use
     neither since these have to be added to the RTEMS installation
     separately. On vxWorks we support the built-in ledLib library.

  Host system storage requirements

     The compressed tar file is approximately 1.6 MB in size. The
     distribution source tree takes up approximately 12 MB. Each host target
     will need around 40 MB for build files, and each cross-compiled target
     around 20 MB.

  Documentation

     EPICS documentation is available through the EPICS website at Argonne.

     Release specific documentation can also be found in the
     base/documentation directory of the distribution.

  Building EPICS base (Unix and Win32)

    Unpack file

       Unzip and untar the distribution file. Use WinZip on Windows systems.

    Set environment variables

       Files in the base/startup directory have been provided to help set
       required path and other environment variables.

       EPICS_HOST_ARCH
       Before you can build or use EPICS R3.15, the environment variable
       EPICS_HOST_ARCH must be defined. A perl script EpicsHostArch.pl in the
       base/startup directory has been provided to help set EPICS_HOST_ARCH.
       You should have EPICS_HOST_ARCH set to your host operating system
       followed by a dash and then your host architecture, e.g.
       solaris-sparc. If you are not using the OS vendor's c/c++ compiler for
       host builds, you will need another dash followed by the alternate
       compiler name (e.g. "-gnu" for GNU c/c++ compilers on a solaris host
       or "-mingw" for MinGW c/c++ compilers on a WIN32 host). See
       configure/CONFIG_SITE for a list of supported EPICS_HOST_ARCH values.

       PERLLIB
       On WIN32, some versions of Perl require that the environment variable
       PERLLIB be set to <perl directory location>.

       PATH
       As already mentioned, you must have the perl executable and you may
       need C and C++ compilers in your search path. For building base you
       also must have echo in your search path. For Unix host builds you also
       need ln, cpp, cp, rm, mv, and mkdir in your search path and /bin/chmod
       must exist. On some Unix systems you may also need ar and ranlib in
       your path, and the C compiler may require as and ld in your path. On
       solaris systems you need uname in your path.

       LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       R3.15 shared libraries and executables normally contain the full path
       to any libraries they require. However, if you move the EPICS files or
       directories from their build-time location then in order for the
       shared libraries to be found at runtime LD_LIBRARY_PATH must include
       the full pathname to $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH) when
       invoking executables, or some equivalent OS-specific mechanism (such
       as /etc/ld.so.conf on Linux) must be used. Shared libraries are now
       built by default on all Unix type hosts.

    Do site-specific build configuration

       Site configuration
       To configure EPICS, you may want to modify the default definitions in
       the following files:

         configure/CONFIG_SITE      Build choices. Specify target archs.
         configure/CONFIG_SITE_ENV  Environment variable defaults
         configure/RELEASE          TORNADO2 full path location

       Host configuration
       To configure each host system, you may override the default
       definitions by adding a new file in the configure/os directory with
       override definitions. The new file should have the same name as the
       distribution file to be overridden except with CONFIG in the name
       changed to CONFIG_SITE.

         configure/os/CONFIG.<host>.<host>      Host build settings
         configure/os/CONFIG.<host>.Common      Host common build settings

       Target configuration
       To configure each target system, you may override the default
       definitions by adding a new file in the configure/os directory with
       override definitions. The new file should have the same name as the
       distribution file to be overridden except with CONFIG in the name
       replaced by CONFIG_SITE. This step is necessary even if the host
       system is the only target system.

         configure/os/CONFIG.Common.<target>     Target common settings
         configure/os/CONFIG.<host>.<target>     Host-target settings

    Build EPICS base

       After configuring the build you should be able to build EPICS base by
       issuing the following commands in the distribution's root directory
       (base):

         gnumake clean uninstall
         gnumake

       The command "gnumake clean uninstall" will remove all files and
       directories generated by a previous build. The command "gnumake" will
       build and install everything for the configured host and targets.

       It is recommended that you do a "gnumake clean uninstall" at the root
       directory of an EPICS directory structure before each complete rebuild
       to ensure that all components will be rebuilt.

  Example application and extension

     A perl tool, makeBaseApp.pl is included in the distribution file. This
     script will create a sample application that can be built and then
     executed to try out this release of base.

     Instructions for building and executing the 3.15 example application can
     be found in the section "Example Application" of Chapter 2, "Getting
     Started", in the "IOC Application Developer's Guide" for this release.
     The "Example IOC Application" section briefly explains how to create and
     build an example application in a user created <top> directory. It also
     explains how to run the example application on a vxWorks ioc or as a
     process on the host system. By running the example application as a
     host-based IOC, you will be able to quickly implement a complete EPICS
     system and be able to run channel access clients on the host system.

     A perl script, makeBaseExt.pl, is included in the distribution file.
     This script will create a sample extension that can be built and
     executed. The makeBaseApp.pl and makeBaseExt.pl scripts are installed
     into the install location bin/<hostarch> directory during the base
     build.

  Multiple host platforms

     You can build using a single EPICS directory structure on multiple host
     systems and for multiple cross target systems. The intermediate and
     binary files generated by the build will be created in separate
     subdirectories and installed into the appropriate separate host/target
     install directories. EPICS executables and perl scripts are installed
     into the $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch> directories. Libraries are
     installed into $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/<arch>. The default definition
     for $(INSTALL_LOCATION) is $(TOP) which is the root directory in the
     distribution directory structure, base. Created object files are stored
     in O.<arch> source subdirectories, This allows objects for multiple
     cross target architectures to be maintained at the same time. To build
     EPICS base for a specific host/target combination you must have the
     proper host/target C/C++ cross compiler and target header files and the
     base/configure/os directory must have the appropriate configure files.
