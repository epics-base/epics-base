1. Macro substitution library
-----------------------------

This library could be used directly by applications which need to
support macro substitution. It will be implemented on all platforms.

1.1 Core library
----------------

The core library provides a minimal set of basic operations. Some
utility routines, described later, use core routines to provide a more
convenient interface for some purposes.

a) long macCreateHandle( MAC_HANDLE **handle, char *pairs[] );
   void macSuppressWarning(MAC_HANDLE *handle,int falseTrue);

   Creates a new macro substitution context and returns an opaque handle
   to that context. An application can, if it desires, have several
   active contexts, although most will not.

   If desired, an initial set of macro definitions may be loaded
   ("pairs" is set to NULL to avoid this). The definitions are in the
   "standard" pairs format, as described under macParseDefns().

   Note that MAC_HANDLE is a typedef for the context structure. The
   opaque handle is of type "MAC_HANDLE *", which is a pointer to the
   context structure. The memory for this context is allocated by this
   routine.

   macSuppressWarning can be called to suppress the marning message
   when macExpandString cant expand a macro. A non zero value will
   suppress the messages.


c) long macGetValue ( MAC_HANDLE *handle, char *name,
                      char *value, long maxlen );

   Returns up to maxlen characters of the value of macro "name". "value"
   will be zero-terminated if the length of the value is less than
   maxlen. The function value will be the number of characters copied to
   "value" (see below for behavior if the macro is undefined). If maxlen
   is zero, no characters will be copied to "value" (which can be NULL)
   and the call can be used to check whether the macro is defined. Note
   that truncation of the value is therefore not reported. Is this a
   problem?

   If the macro is undefined, the macro reference will be returned in
   the value string (if permitted by maxlen) and the function value will
   be _minus_ the number of characters copied. Note that treatment of
   maxlen is intended to be consistent with what people are used to with
   strncpy().

   If the value contains macro references then the references will be
   expanded recursively. This expansion will detect a direct or indirect
   self reference.

   Macro references begin with a "$" immediately followed by either a
   "(" or a "{" character. The macro name comes next, and may optionally
   be succeeded by an "=" and a default value, which will be returned if
   the named macro is undefined at the moment of expansion. The reference
   is terminated by the matching ")" or "}" character.

d) long macPutValue( MAC_HANDLE *handle, char *name, char *value );

   Sets the value of the macro "name". If "value" is NULL, it undefines
   all instances of "name" at all scoping levels (it's not an error if
   "name" is not defined in this case). Macros referenced by "value"
   need not be defined at this point.

   The function returns the length of the value string.

e) long macDeleteHandle( MAC_HANDLE *handle );

   Marks a handle invalid, and frees all storage associated with it.

   Note that this does not free any strings into which macro values have
   been returned. Macro values are always returned into strings which
   were pre-allocated by the caller.

f) long macPushScope( MAC_HANDLE *handle );

   Marks the start of a new scoping level such that all definitions made
   up until the next macPopScope() call will be lost on macPopScope()
   and those current at macPushScope() will be re-instated.

g) long macPopScope( MAC_HANDLE *handle );

   See macPushScope.

h) Error handling

   These routines conform to 0 (=OK) for success, -1 (=ERROR) for
   failure, and small positive values for extra info. I contravened this
   for macGetValue() and macExpandString() because I felt that it was
   worth returning information both on success / failure and on value
   length.

   Errors and warnings are reported using errlogPrintf().



1.2 Utility library
-------------------

These are convenience functions. If other useful functions emerge during
implementation, the list may grow.

a) macParseDefns( MAC_HANDLE  *handle, char *defns, char **pairs[] );

   This takes a set of macro definitions in "a=xxx,b=yyy" format and
   converts them into an array of pointers to character strings which
   are, in order, "first name", "first value", "second name", "second
   value" etc. The array is terminated with two NULL pointers and all
   storage is allocated contiguously so that it can be freed with a
   single call to free().

   This routine is independent of any handle and provides a generally
   useful service which may be used elsewhere. Any macro references in
   values are not expanded at this point since the referenced macros may
   be defined or redefined before the macro actually has to be
   translated.

   Shell-style escapes and quotes are supported, as are things like
   "A=B,B=$(C$(A)),CA=CA,CB=CB" (sets B to "CB"). White space is
   significant within values but ignored elsewhere (i.e. surrounding "="
   and "," characters).

   Probably noone will ever want to, but the special meanings of "$",
   "{", "}", "(", ")", "=" and "," can all be changed via macPutXxxx()
   calls.  This routine does not have a handle argument, so they must be
   changed globally for it to use the new definitions. Should it have a
   handle argument? This makes it more of a pain to use but guarantees
   that there will be no conflicts. I think it should really.

   The function value is the number of definitions encountered, or -1 if
   the supplied string is invalid.

b) long macInstallMacros( MAC_HANDLE *handle, char *pairs[] );

   This takes an array of pairs as defined above and installs them as
   definitions by calling macPutValue(). The pairs array is terminated
   by a NULL pointer.

   The function value is the number of macros defined.

c) long macExpandString( MAC_HANDLE *handle, char *src,
                         char *dest, long maxlen );

   This operates on a string which may contain macro references. It
   parses the string looking for such references and passes them to
   macGetValue() for translation. It returns the expanded string in the
   supplied argument.

   The function value is similar to that of macGetValue(). Its absolute
   value is the number of characters copied. If negative, at least one
   undefined macro has been left unexpanded.

d) char *macEnvExpand( char *src );

   This operates on a string which may contain macros defined by
   environment variables. It parses the string looking for such
   references and passes them to macGetValue() for translation. It uses
   malloc() to allocate space for the expanded string and returns a
   pointer to this null-terminated string. It returns NULL if the source
   string contains any undefined references.

e) long macReportMacros( MAC_HANDLE *handle );

   This reports details of current definitions to standard output, and is
   intended purely for debugging purposes.
