<p>EPICS::IOC - Manage an EPICS IOC</p>

>SYNOPSIS</a></h1>

<h1><a class='u'
name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>This module provides an object-oriented API for starting, interacting with and stopping one or more EPICS IOCs under program control, and is generally intended for writing test programs.</p>

<p>The IOC should not be configured to emit unsolicited messages on stdout as this could interfere with the ability of the software to detect an end-of-command from the IOC shell, which is achieved by setting the prompt to a known string (normally <code>__END__</code>). Unsolicited messages on stderr will not cause problems, but can&#39;t be seen on Windows systems.</p>

<h1><a class='u'
name="CONSTRUCTOR"
>CONSTRUCTOR</a></h1>

<dl>
<dt><a name="new-()"
>new ()</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Calling <code>new</code> creates an <code>EPICS::IOC</code> object that can be used to start and interact with a single IOC. After this IOC has been shut down (by calling its <code>exit</code> or <code>close</code> methods) the <code>EPICS::IOC</code> object may be reused for another IOC.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h1><a class='u'
name="METHODS"
>METHODS</a></h1>

<dl>
<dt><a name="debug-(-[FLAG]-)"
>debug ( [FLAG] )</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Each <code>EPICS::IOC</code> object has its own debug flag which when non-zero causes all IOC console traffic sent or read by other methods to be printed to stdout along with the IOC&#39;s pid and a direction indicator. The <code>debug</code> method optionally sets and returns the value of this flag.</p>

<p>The optional FLAG is treated as a true/false value. If provided this sets the debug flag value.</p>

<p>The method&#39;s return value is the current (new if given) value of the flag.</p>

<dt><a name="start-(-EXECUTABLE-[,-ARGUMENTS-...]-)"
>start ( EXECUTABLE [, ARGUMENTS ...] )</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Launch an IOC binary given by EXECUTABLE with ARGUMENTS. The method dies if it can&#39;t run the program as given, or if the IOC is already running.</p>

<p>In most cases the <code>cmd</code> method should be called next with no command string, which waits for the IOC&#39;s boot process to finish and the first iocsh prompt to be displayed.</p>

<p>The <code>start</code> method sets two environment variables that control how the IOC shell behaves: <code>IOCSH_HISTEDIT_DISABLE</code> is set to prevent it calling the GNU Readline library, and <code>IOCSH_PS1</code> is set to a known string which is used as a terminator for the previous command.</p>

<dt><a name="pid-()"
>pid ()</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Returns the process-ID of the IOC process, or undef if the IOC process has not yet been started.</p>

<dt><a name="started-()"
>started ()</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Returns a true value if the IOC has been started and not yet closed. This state will not change if the IOC dies by itself, it indicates that the <code>start</code> method has been called but not the <code>close</code> method.</p>

<dt><a name="_send-(-COMMAND-)"
>_send ( COMMAND )</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>The <code>_send</code> method is a primitive for internal use that sends a COMMAND string to the IOC shell, and prints it to stdout if the debug flag is set.</p>

<dt><a name="_getline-()"
>_getline ()</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>The <code>_getline</code> method is also designed for internal use, it fetches a single line output by the IOC, and prints it to stdout if the debug flag is set.</p>

<p>Any CR/LF is stripped from the line before returning it. If the stream gets closed because the IOC shuts down an <code>EOF</code> debug message may be shown and an undef value will be returned.</p>

<dt><a name="_getlines-(-[TERM]-)"
>_getlines ( [TERM] )</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Another internal method <code>_getlines</code> fetches multiple lines from the IOC. It takes an optional TERM string or regexp parameter which is matched against each input line in turn to determine when the IOC&#39;s output has been completed. Termination also occurs on an EOF from the output stream.</p>

<p>The return value is a list of all the lines received (with the final CR/LF stripped) including the line that matched the terminator.</p>

<dt><a name="_geterrors-(-)"
>_geterrors ( )</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Returns a list of lines output by the IOC to stderr since last called. Only complete lines are included, with trailing newline char&#39;s removed.</p>

<p>NOTE: This doesn&#39;t work on Windows because it uses select which Perl doesn&#39;t support on that OS, but it doesn&#39;t seem to cause any problems for short-lived IOCs at least, it just never returns any text from the IOC&#39;s stderr output.</p>

<dt><a name="cmd-(-[COMMAND-[,-ARGUMENTS-...]]-)"
>cmd ( [COMMAND [, ARGUMENTS ...]] )</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>If the <code>cmd</code> method is given an optional COMMAND string along with any number of ARGUMENTS it constructs a command-line, quoting each argument as necessary. This is sent to the IOC and a line read back and discarded if it matches the command-line.</p>

<p>With no COMMAND string the method starts here; it then collects lines from the IOC until one matches the terminator. A list of all the lines received prior to the terminator line is returned.</p>

<dt><a name="exit-()"
>exit ()</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>The <code>exit</code> method attempts to stop and clean up after an IOC that is still running. It sends an <code>exit</code> command to the IOC shell (without waiting for a response), then calls the <code>close</code> method to finish the task of shutting down the IOC process and tidying up after it.</p>

<dt><a name="close-()"
>close ()</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>The <code>close</code> method first closes the IOC&#39;s stdin stream, which will trigger an end-of-file to the IOC shell, then it fetches any remaining lines from the IOC&#39;s stdout stream before closing both that and the stderr stream. Finally (unless we&#39;re running on MS-Windows) it sends a SIGTERM signal to the child process and waits for it to clean up. A list containing the final output from the IOC&#39;s stdout stream is returned.</p>

<dt><a name="DESTROY-()"
>DESTROY ()</a></dt>

<dd>
<p><code>EPICS::IOC</code> objects have a destructor which calls the <code>exit</code> method, but it is not recommended that this be relied on to terminate an IOC process. Better to use an <code>END {}</code> block and/or trap the necessary signals and explicitly <code>exit</code> or <code>close</code> the IOC.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h1><a class='u'
name="CONVENIENCE-METHODS"
>CONVENIENCE METHODS</a></h1>

<p>The following methods provide an easy way to perform various common IOC operations.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="dbLoadRecords-(-FILE-[,-MACROS]-)"
>dbLoadRecords ( FILE [, MACROS] )</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Instructs the IOC to load a database (.db) from FILE. If provided, the MACROS parameter is a single string containing one or more comma-separated assignment statements like <code>a=1</code> for macros that are used in the database file.</p>

<p>This method can also be used to load a database definition (.dbd) file.</p>

<dt><a name="iocInit-()"
>iocInit ()</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Start the IOC executing.</p>

<dt><a name="dbl-(-[RECORDTYPE])"
>dbl ( [RECORDTYPE])</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This method uses the <code>dbl</code> command to fetch a list of all of the record names the IOC has loaded. If a RECORDTYPE name is given, the list will only comprise records of that type.</p>

<dt><a name="dbgf-(-PV-)"
>dbgf ( PV )</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>The <code>dbgf</code> method returns the value of the process variable PV, or <code>undef</code> if the PV doesn&#39;t exist. This only works when the PV holds a scalar or an array with one element.</p>

<dt><a name="dbpf-(-PV,-VALUE-)"
>dbpf ( PV, VALUE )</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This method sets PV to VALUE, and returns the new value, or <code>undef</code> if the PV doesn&#39;t exist. If the put fails the return value is the previous value of the PV. As with the <code>dbgf</code> method this only works for scalar or single-element arrays, but PV may be an array field which will be set to one element.</p>
</dd>
