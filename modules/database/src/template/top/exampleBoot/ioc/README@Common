To start the ioc from this directory execute the command
    ../../bin/_ARCH_/<appname> st.cmd

Alternatively make the st.cmd file directly executable with
    chmod +x st.cmd
and check the executable name on the first line of the st.cmd file

You may need to change the name of the .dbd file given in the
st.cmd's dbLoadDatabase() command before starting the ioc.
