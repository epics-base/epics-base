#- Instructions for creating and using a real nfsCommands file
#- 
#- in order to use nfs do the following:
#- 1) Create hostAdd and nfsMount commands for each nfs server
#- 2) In each st.cmd file add the following two commands BEFORE any load commands
#-    ../nfs.cmd
#-    cd "<iocname>
#- 
#- The hostAdd command has the form:
#- hostAdd("<host>","xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx")
#- 
#- The vxWorks nfsMount command has the form:
#- nfsMount("<host>")
#-
#- You can also mount subdirectories as follows:
#- nfsMount("<host>", "/xxx/xxx/xxx", "/xxx")
#- 
#- For example assume
#- 
#- host is mercury with inet address 155.77.2.56
#- You want to mount the directory (which is a file system of mercury)
#- /home/mercury5/iocinfo
#-    as
#- /iocinfo
#- 
#- The commands would be
#- 
#- hostAdd("mercury","155.77.2.56")
#- nfsMount("mercury","/home/mercury5/iocinfo","/iocinfo")
