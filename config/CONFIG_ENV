# EPICS_CA_BEACON_PERIOD 
#	quiescent sec between server beacons.
# EPICS_CAS_INTF_ADDR_LIST - list of IP addresses identifying
#	a limited set of network interfaces for server communication. 
#	Specifically, this parameter specifies the interfaces from
#	which the server will accept TCP/IP connections. It also 
#	specifies that UDP search messages addressed to both
#	the IP addresses in EPICS_CAS_INTF_ADDR_LIST and also
#	the broadcast addresses (or the destination addresses of 
#	point to point interfaces) of the corresponding interfaces
#	will be accepted by the server. If this parameter is empty 
#	then TCP/IP connections are accepted from any interface
#	(and any search messages addressed to the host are accepted). 
#	Beacons are sent only to the broadcast address of each interface 
#	in this list (or the destination address of point to point 
#	interfaces) if EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST is YES. 
#	Type "ifconfig -a" in order to determine which interfaces 
#	are available.
# EPICS_CAS_BEACON_ADDR_LIST - If this parameter is specified
#	or if EPICS_CAS_INTF_ADDR_LIST isnt empty then this parameter
#	is used instead of EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST by the server library 
# 	to augment the list of addresses to send beacons to.
# EPICS_CAS_SERVER_PORT - If this parameter is specified then it
#	and not EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT is used to determine the server's
# 	port number. It is possible to have multiple servers on the
#	same host on the same EPICS_CAS_SERVER_PORT port if the IP
#	kernel is modern (if it has multicast enhancements). In this
#	situation all servers will share the same user specified 
#	UDP port number and will be assigned unique TCP port numbers. 
#	The fact that the servers may not be using the user specified
#	port number for TCP will be completely transparent to EPICS 
#	3.13 or higher clients that will be locating the servers
#	using the user specified UDP port number, but will be connecting to
#	the servers using whatever TCP port has been assigned.
#
#   If experiencing trouble getting clients to connect
#	--------------------------------------------------
#
#	o Make sure that the broadcast addresses are identical on the
#	server's host and on the client's host. This can be checked with
#	"netstat -i" or "ifconfig -a".
#	
#	o Make sure that the client and server are using the same UDP
#	port. Check the server's port by running "netstat -a | grep nnn"
#	where nnn is the port number involved. If you do not set 
#	EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT or EPICS_CAS_SERVER_PORT 
#	then the default port will be 5064.
#	
#	o Two servers can run on the same host with the same server port number
#	if the following restrictions are understood (good luck). If the host has a
#	modern IP kernel it is possible to have two servers on the same UDP port.
#	It is not possible for two servers to run on the same host using the same 
#	TCP IP server port. If the CA server library detects that a 2nd server is attempting
#	to start on the same port as an existing CA server then both servers will use the 
#	same UDP port if it is a modern IP kernel, and the 2nd server will
#	be allocated a new TCP port. In this situation the clients will still be
#	configured to use the same port number for both servers. The clients
#	will find the 2nd server via the shared UDP port, and transparently
#	connect to the 2nd server's allocated TCP port. Be aware that If there are 
#	two server's running on the same host on the same UDP port then they will 
#	both receive all UDP search requests sent as broadcasts, but will unfortunately (due to 
#	what I consider to be a real weakness of most IP kernel implementations) only one 
#	of the servers will typically receive UDP search requests sent to unicast addresses (i.e. 
#	a specific host's ip address).
