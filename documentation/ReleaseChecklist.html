<h1>EPICS Base Release Procedures &amp; Checklist</h1>

<p>This document describes the procedures and provides a checklist of tasks
that should be performed when creating production releases of EPICS Base.</p>

<h3>The Release Process</h3>

<p>We used to have one written down here, but we weren't following it very
closely so now the decision to make a new release is taken during the Core
Developers bi-weekly meetings in an informal manner. The steps detailed below
were written to remind Andrew (or anyone else who does the release) about
everything that has to be done since it's so easy to miss steps.</p>

<h3>Roles</h3>

<p>The following roles are used below:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Release Manager</strong> ()</dt>
    <dd>Responsible for managing and tagging the release</dd>
  <dt><strong>Platform Developers</strong> (informal)</dt>
    <dd>Responsible for individual operating system platforms</dd>
  <dt><strong>Application Developers</strong></dt>
    <dd>Responsible for support modules that depend on EPICS Base.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Website Editor</strong> (Andrew Johnson)</dt>
    <dd>Responsible for the EPICS website</dd>
</dl>
