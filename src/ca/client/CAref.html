<h3>Why Reconfigure Channel Access</h3>

<p>Typical reasons to reconfigure EPICS Channel Access:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two independent control systems must share a network without fear of
    interaction</li>
  <li>A test system must not interact with an operational system</li>
  <li>Use of address lists instead of broadcasts for name resolution and server
    beacons</li>
  <li>Control system occupies multiple IP subnets</li>
  <li>Nonstandard client disconnect time outs or server beacon intervals</li>
  <li>Specify the local time zone</li>
  <li>Transport of large arrays</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="EPICS">EPICS Environment Variables</a></h3>

<p>All Channel Access (CA) configuration occurs through EPICS environment
variables. When searching for an EPICS environment variable EPICS first looks
in the environment using the ANSI C getenv() call. If no matching variable
exists then the default specified in the EPICS build system configuration files
is used.</p>

<h3><a name="CA and Wide Area Networks"></a>CA and Wide Area Networks</h3>

<p>Normally in a local area network (LAN) environment CA discovers the address
of the host for an EPICS process variable by broadcasting frames containing a
list of channel names (CA search messages) and waiting for responses from the
servers that host the channels identified. Likewise CA clients efficiently
discover that CA servers have recently joined the LAN or disconnected from the
LAN by monitoring periodically broadcasted beacons sent out by the servers.
Since hardware broadcasting requires special hardware capabilities, we are
required to provide additional configuration information when EPICS is extended
to operate over a wide area network (WAN).</p>

<h3><a name="Network">IP Network Administration Background Information</a></h3>

<p>Channel Access is implemented using Internet protocols (IP). IP addresses
are divided into host and network portions. The boundary between each portion
is determined by the IP netmask. Portions of the IP address corresponding to
zeros in the netmask specify the hosts address within an IP subnet. Portions of
the IP address corresponding to binary ones in the netmask specify the address
of a host's IP subnet. Normally the scope of a broadcasted frame will be
limited to one IP subnet. Addresses with the host address portion set to all
zeros or all ones are special. Modern IP kernel implementations reserve
destination addresses with the host portion set to all ones for the purpose of
addressing broadcasts to a particular subnet. In theory we can issue a
broadcast frame on any broadcast capable LAN within the interconnected Internet
by specifying the proper subnet address combined with a host portion set to all
ones. In practice these "directed broadcasts" are frequently limited by the
default router configuration. The proper directed broadcast address required to
reach a particular host can be obtained by logging into that host and typing
the command required by your local operating environment. Ignore the loop back
interface and use the broadcast address associated with an interface connected
to a path through the network to your client. Typically there will be only one
Ethernet interface.</p>

<p>IP ports are positive integers. The IP address, port number, and protocol
type uniquely identify the source and destination of a particular frame
transmitted between computers. Servers are typically addressed by a well known
port number. Clients are assigned a unique ephemeral port number during
initialization. IP ports below 1024 are reserved for servers that provide
standardized facilities such as mail or file transfer. Port number between 1024
and 5000 are typically reserved for ephemeral port number assignments.</p>

<h3><a name="port">IP port numbers</a></h3>

<p>The two default IP port numbers used by Channel Access may be reconfigured.
This might occur when a site decides to set up two or more completely
independent control systems that will share the same network. For instance, a
site might set up an operational control system and a test control system on
the same network. In this situation it is desirable for the test system and the
operational system to use identical PV names without fear of collision. A site
might also configure the CA port numbers because some other facility is already
using the default port numbers. The default Channel Access port numbers have
been registered with IANA.</p>

<p>If a client needs to communicate with two servers that are residing at
different port numbers then an extended syntax may be used with the
EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST environment variable. See <a href="#Environmen">WAN
Environment</a> below.</p>

<h3><a name="firewall">Firewalls</a></h3>

<p>If you want channel access clients on a machine to be able to see beacons
and replies to broadcast PV search requests, you need to permit inbound UDP
packets with source port EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT (default is 5064) or destination
port EPICS_CA_REPEATER_PORT (default is 5065). On systems using iptables this
can be accomplished by rules like</p>
<pre>     -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/22 -p udp --sport 5064 -j ACCEPT
     -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/22 -p udp --dport 5065 -j ACCEPT</pre>

<p>If you want channel access servers (e.g. "soft IOCs") on a machine to be
able to be seen by clients, you need to permit inbound TCP or UDP packets with
destination port EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT (default is 5064). On systems using
iptables this can be accomplished by rules like</p>
<pre>     -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/22 -p udp --dport 5064 -j ACCEPT
     -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/22 -p tcp --dport 5064 -j ACCEPT</pre>

<p>In all cases the "-s 192.168.0.0/22" specifies the range of addresses from
which you wish to accept packets.</p>

<h3><a name="Environmen">WAN Environment</a></h3>

<p>When the CA client library connects a channel it must first determine the IP
address of the server the channels Process Variable resides on. To accomplish
this the client sends name resolution (search) requests to a list of server
destination addresses. These server destination addresses can be IP unicast
addresses (individual host addresses) or IP broadcast addresses. Each name
resolution (search) request contains a list of Process Variable names.If one of
the servers reachable by this address list knows the IP address of a CA server
that can service one or more of the specified Process Variables, then it sends
back a response containing the server's IP address and port number.</p>

<p>During initialization CA builds the list of server destination addresses
used when sending CA client name resolution (search) requests. This table is
initialized by introspecting the network interfaces attached to the host. For
each interface found that is attached to a broadcast capable IP subnet, the
broadcast address of that subnet is added to the list. For each point to point
interface found, the destination address of that link is added to the list.
This automatic server address list initialization can be disabled if the EPICS
environment variable EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST exists and its value is either
"no" or "NO". The typical default is to enable network interface introspection
driven initialization with EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST set to "YES" or "yes".</p>

<p>Following network interface introspection, any IP addresses specified in the
EPICS environment variable EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST are added to the list of
destination addresses for CA client name resolution requests. In an EPICS
system crossing multiple subnets the EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST must be set so that CA
name resolution (search requests) frames pass from CA clients to the targeted
CA servers unless a CA proxy (gateway) is installed. The addresses in
EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST may be dotted IP addresses or host names if the local OS has
support for host name to IP address translation. When multiple names are added
to EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST they must be separated by white space. There is no
requirement that the addresses specified in the EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST be broadcast
addresses, but this will often be the most convenient choice.</p>

<p>For any IP addresses specified in the EPICS environment variable
EPICS_CA_NAME_SERVERS, TCP connections are opened and used for CA client name
resolution requests. (Thus, broadcast addresses are not allowed in
EPICS_CA_NAME_SERVERS.) When used in combination with an empty
EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST and EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST set to "NO", Channel Access can
be run without using UDP for name resolution. Such an TCP-only mode allows for
Channel Access to work e.g. through SSH tunnels.</p>

<p>If a client needs to communicate with two servers that are residing at
different port numbers then an extended syntax may be used with the
EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST environment variable. Each host name or IP address in the
EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST may be immediately followed by a colon and an IP port number
without intervening whitespace. Entries that do not specify a port number will
default to EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT.</p>

<h4><a name="Routing">Routing Restrictions on vxWorks Systems</a></h4>

<p>Frequently vxWorks systems boot by default with routes limiting access only
to the local subnet. If a EPICS system is operating in a WAN environment it may
be necessary to configure routes into the vxWorks system which enable a vxWorks
based CA server to respond to requests originating outside its subnet. These
routing restrictions can also apply to vxWorks base CA clients communicating
with off subnet servers. An EPICS system manager can implement an rudimentary,
but robust, form of access control for a particular host by not providing
routes in that host that reach outside of a limited set of subnets. See
"routeLib" in the vxWorks reference manual.</p>

<h3><a name="Disconnect">Disconnect Time Out Interval</a></h3>

<p>If the CA client library does not see a beacon from a server that it is
connected to for EPICS_CA_CONN_TMO seconds then an state-of-health message is
sent to the server over TCP/IP. If this state-of-health message isn't promptly
replied to then the client library will conclude that channels communicating
with the server are no longer responsive and inform the CA client side
application via function callbacks. The parameter EPICS_CA_CONN_TMO is
specified in floating point seconds. The default is typically 30 seconds. For
efficient operation it is recommended that EPICS_CA_CONN_TMO be set to no less
than twice the value specified for EPICS_CA_BEACON_PERIOD.</p>

<p>Prior to EPICS R3.14.5 an unresponsive server implied an immediate TCP
circuit disconnect, immediate resumption of UDP based search requests, and
immediate attempts to reconnect. There was concern about excessive levels of
additional activity when servers are operated close to the edge of resource
limitations. Therefore with version R3.14.5 and greater the CA client library
continues to inform client side applications when channels are unresponsive,
but does not immediately disconnect the TCP circuit. Instead the CA client
library postpones circuit shutdown until receiving indication of circuit
disconnect from the IP kernel. This can occur either because a server is
restarted or because the IP kernel's internal TCP circuit inactivity keep alive
timer has expired after a typically long duration (as is appropriate for IP
based systems that need to avoid thrashing during periods of excessive load).
The net result is less search and TCP circuit setup and shutdown activity
during periods of excessive load.</p>

<h3><a name="Dynamic">Dynamic Changes in the CA Client Library Search
Interval</a></h3>

<p>The CA client library will continuously attempt to connect any CA channels
that an application has created until it is successful. The library
periodically queries the server destination address list described above with
name resolution requests for any unresolved channels. Since this address list
frequently contains broadcast addresses, and because nonexistent process
variable names are frequently configured, or servers may be temporarily
unavailable, then it is necessary for the CA client library internals to
carefully schedule these requests in time to avoid introducing excessive load
on the network and the servers.</p>

<p>When the CA client library has many channels to connect, and most of its
name resolution requests are responded to, then it sends name resolution
requests at an interval that is twice the estimated round trip interval for the
set of servers responding, or at the minimum delay quantum for the operating
system - whichever is greater. The number of UDP frames per interval is also
dynamically adjusted based on the past success rates.</p>

<p>If a name resolution request is not responded to, then the client library
doubles the delay between name resolution attempts and reduces the number of
requests per interval. The maximum delay between attempts is limited by
EPICS_CA_MAX_SEARCH_PERIOD (see <a href="#Configurin3">Configuring the Maximum
Search Period</a>). Note however that prior to R3.14.7, if the client library
did not receive any responses over a long interval it stopped sending name
resolution attempts altogether until a beacon anomaly was detected (see
below).</p>

<p>The CA client library continually estimates the beacon period of all server
beacons received. If a particular server's beacon period becomes significantly
shorter or longer then the client is said to detect a beacon anomaly. The
library boosts the search interval for unresolved channels when a beacon
anomaly is seen or when <em>any</em> successful search response is received,
but with a longer initial interval between requests than is used when the
application creates a channel. Creation of a new channel does <em>not</em>
(starting with EPICS R3.14.7) change the interval used when searching for
preexisting unresolved channels. The program "casw" prints a message on
standard out for each CA client beacon anomaly detect event.</p>

<p>See also <a href="#Client1">When a Client Does not See the Server's
Beacon</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="Configurin3">Configuring the Maximum Search
Period</a></h3>

<p>The rate at which name resolution (search) requests are sent exponentially
backs off to a plateau rate. The value of this plateau has an impact on network
traffic because it determines the rate that clients search for channel names
that are miss-spelled or otherwise don't exist in a server. Furthermore, for
clients that are unable to see the beacon from a new server, the plateau rate
may also determine the maximum interval that the client will wait until
discovering a new server.</p>

<p>Starting with EPICS R3.14.7 this maximum search rate interval plateau in
seconds is determined by the EPICS_CA_MAX_SEARCH_PERIOD environment
variable.</p>

<p>See also <a href="#Client1">When a Client Does not See the Server's
Beacon</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="Repeater">The CA Repeater</a></h3>

<p>When several client processes run on the same host it is not possible for
all of them to directly receive a copy of the server beacon messages when the
beacon messages are sent to unicast addresses, or when legacy IP kernels are
still in use. To avoid confusion over these restrictions a special UDP server,
the CA Repeater, is automatically spawned by the CA client library when it is
not found to be running. This program listens for server beacons sent to the
UDP port specified in the EPICS_CA_REPEATER_PORT parameter and fans any beacons
received out to any CA client program running on the same host that have
registered themselves with the CA Repeater. If the CA Repeater is not already
running on a workstation, then the "caRepeater" program must be in your path
before using the CA client library for the first time.</p>

<p>If a host based IOC is run on the same workstation with standalone CA client
processes, then it is probably best to start the caRepeater process when the
workstation is booted. Otherwise it is possible for the standalone CA client
processes to become dependent on a CA repeater started within the confines of
the host based IOC. As long as the host based IOC continues to run there is
nothing wrong with this situation, but problems could arise if this host based
IOC process exits before the standalone client processes which are relying on
its CA repeater for services exit.</p>

<p>Since the repeater is intended to be shared by multiple clients then it
could be argued that it makes less sense to set up a CA repeater that listens
for beacons on only a subset of available network interfaces. In the worst case
situation the client library might see beacon anomalies from servers that it is
not interested in. Modifications to the CA repeater forcing it to listen only
on a subset of network interfaces might be considered for a future release if
there appear to be situations that require it.</p>

<h3><a name="Configurin">Configuring the Time Zone</a></h3>

<p><em>Note: Starting with EPICS R3.14 all of the libraries in the EPICS base
distribution rely on facilities built into the operating system to determine
the correct time zone. Nevertheless, several programs commonly used with EPICS
still use the original "tssubr" library and therefore they still rely on proper
configuration of EPICS_TS_MIN_WEST.</em></p>

<p>While the CA client library does not translate between the local time and
the time zone independent internal storage of EPICS time stamps, many EPICS
client side applications call core EPICS libraries which provide these
services. To set the correct time zone users must compute the number of
positive minutes west of GMT (maximum 720 inclusive) or the negative number of
minutes east of GMT (minimum -720 inclusive). This integer value is then placed
in the variable EPICS_TS_MIN_WEST.</p>

<h3><a name="Configurin1">Configuring the Maximum Array Size</a></h3>

<p>From version R3.16.1, the default setting of EPICS_CA_AUTO_ARRAY_BYTES=YES
will cause the software to ignore EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES and attempt to
allocate network buffer space as needed by the particular client connection
using malloc. Setting EPICS_CA_AUTO_ARRAY_BYTES=NO will configure the software
to respect the EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES setting as described below instead.</p>

<p>Starting with version R3.14 the environment variable
EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES determines the size of the largest array that may pass
through CA. Prior to this version only arrays smaller than 16k bytes could be
transfered. The CA libraries maintains a free list of 16384 byte network
buffers that are used for ordinary communication. If EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES
is larger than 16384 then a second free list of larger data buffers is
established and used only after a client send its first large array request.</p>

<p>The CA client library uses EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES to determines the
maximum array that it will send or receive. Likewise, the CA server uses
EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES to determine the maximum array that it may send or
receive. The client does not influence the server's message size quotas and
visa versa. In fact the value of EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES need not be the same
in the client and the server. If the server receives a request which is too
large to read or respond to in entirety then it sends an exception message to
the client. Likewise, if the CA client library receives a request to send an
array larger than EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES it will return ECA_TOLARGE.</p>

<p>A common mistake is to correctly calculate the maximum datum size in bytes
by multiplying the number of elements by the size of a single element, but
neglect to add additional bytes for the compound data types (for example
DBR_GR_DOUBLE) commonly used by the more sophisticated client side
applications.</p>

<h4>Server Port</h4>

<p>The server configures its port number from the EPICS_CAS_SERVER_PORT
environment variable if it is specified. Otherwise the EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT
environment variable determines the server's port number. Two servers can share
the same UDP port number on the same machine, but there are restrictions - see
a <a href="#Unicast">discussion of unicast addresses and two servers sharing
the same UDP port on the same host</a>.</p>

<h4>Server Beacons</h4>

<p>The EPICS_CAS_BEACON_PERIOD parameter determines the server's beacon period
and is specified in floating point seconds. The default is typically 15
seconds. See also <a href="#Disconnect">EPICS_CA_CONN_TMO</a> and
<a href="#Dynamic">Dynamic Changes in the CA Client Library Search
Interval</a>.</p>

<p>CA servers build a list of addresses to send beacons to during
initialization. If EPICS_CAS_AUTO_BEACON_ADDR_LIST has the value "YES"
(the default) this list will be automatically populated with the broadcast
addresses of all network interfaces. However, if the user also
defines EPICS_CAS_INTF_ADDR_LIST then beacon address list automatic
configuration is constrained to the network interfaces specified therein, and
therefore only the broadcast addresses of the specified LAN interfaces, will be
automatically configured.</p>

<p>If EPICS_CAS_BEACON_ADDR_LIST is defined then its contents will be used to
augment any automatic configuration of the beacon address list. Individual
entries in EPICS_CAS_BEACON_ADDR_LIST may override the destination port number
if ":nnn" follows the host name or IP address there.</p>

<p>The EPICS_CAS_BEACON_PORT parameter specifies the destination port for
server beacons. The only exception to this occurs when ports are specified in
EPICS_CAS_BEACON_ADDR_LIST or possibly in EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST. If
EPICS_CAS_BEACON_PORT is not specified then beacons are sent to the port
specified in EPICS_CA_REPEATER_PORT.</p>

<h4>Binding a Server to a Limited Set of Network Interfaces</h4>

<p>The parameter EPICS_CAS_INTF_ADDR_LIST allows a ca server to bind itself to,
and therefore accept messages received by, a limited set of the local host's
network interfaces (each specified by its IP address). On UNIX systems type
"netstat -ie" (type "ipconfig" on windows) to see a list of the local host's
network interfaces. By default,
the CA server is accessible from all network interfaces configured into its
host.</p>

<p>Until R3.15.4 the CA server employed by iocCore did not
implement the EPICS_CAS_INTF_ADDR_LIST feature.</p>

<p>Prior to R3.15.4 CA servers would build the beacon address list
using EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST if EPICS_CAS_BEACON_ADDR_LIST was no set.</p>

<h4>Ignoring Process Variable Name Resolution Requests From Certain Hosts</h4>

<p>Name resolution requests originating from any of the IP addresses specified
in the EPICS_CAS_IGNORE_ADDR_LIST parameter are not replied to.<em>In R3.14 and
previous releases the CA server employed by iocCore does not implement this
feature.</em></p>

<p>CA server "beacon anomaly" logging.</p>

<p>CA server beacon anomalies occur when a new server joins the network, a

<p>CA clients with unresolved channels reset their search request scheduling
timers whenever they see a beacon anomaly.</p>

<p>This program can be used to detect situations where there are too many
beacon anomalies. IP routing configuration problems may result in false beacon
anomalies that might cause CA clients to use unnecessary additional network
bandwidth and server CPU load when searching for unresolved channels.</p>

<p>If there are no new CA servers appearing on the network, and network
connectivity remains constant, then casw should print no messages at all. At
higher interest levels the program prints a message for every beacon that is

caput -a [options] &lt;PV name&gt; &lt;no of elements&gt; &lt;value&gt; ...</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Put value to a PV.</p>

<p>The specified value is written to the PV (as a string). The PV's value is
read before and after the write operation and printed as "Old" and "New" values
on stdout.</p>

<p>There are two variants to the arguments for this command. For the scalar
variant without the <code>-a</code> flag, all the value arguments provided after
the PV name are concatenated with a single space character between them, and the
resulting string (up to 40 characters long unless the <code>-S</code> flag is
given) is written to the specified PV.</p>

<p>The array variant with the <code>-a</code> flag writes an array of string
values to the specified PV. The numeric argument giving the number of array
elements is actually ignored, the array length to be written is actually
controlled by the number of values provided on the command line.</p>

<h4>Bugs</h4>

<p>Not all of the options listed above have been tested recently.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>

<h3><a name="When">When Clients Do Not Connect to Their Server</a></h3>

<h4><a name="Broadcast">Client and Server Broadcast Addresses Don't
Match</a></h4>

<p>Verify that the broadcast addresses are identical on the server's host and
on the client's host. This can be checked on UNIX with "netstat -i" or
"ifconfig -a"; on vxWorks with ifShow; and on windows with ipconfig. It is
normal for the broadcast addresses to not be identical if the client and server
are not directly attached to the same IP subnet, and in this situation the
EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST must be set. Otherwise, if the client and server are
intended to be on the same IP subnet, then the problem may be that the IP
netmask is incorrectly set in the network interface configuration. On most
operating systems, when the host's IP address is configured, the host's IP
subnet mask is also configured.</p>

<h4><a name="Client">Client Isn't Configured to Use the Server's Port</a></h4>

<p>Verify that the client and server are using the same UDP port. Check the
server's port by running "netstat -a | grep nnn" where nnn is the port number
configured in the client. If you do not set EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT or
EPICS_CAS_SERVER_PORT then the default port will be 5064.</p>

<h4><a name="Unicast">Unicast Addresses in the EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST Does not
Reliably Contact Servers Sharing the Same UDP Port on the Same Host</a></h4>

<p>Two servers can run on the same host with the same server port number, but
there are restrictions. If the host has a modern IP kernel it is possible to
have two or more servers share the same UDP port. It is not possible for these
servers to run on the same host using the same TCP port. If the CA server
library detects that a server is attempting to start on the same port as an
existing CA server then both servers will use the same UDP port, and the 2nd
server will be allocated an ephemeral TCP port. Clients can be configured to
use the same port number for both servers. They will locate the 2nd server via
the shared UDP port, and transparently connect to the 2nd server's ephemeral
TCP port. Be aware however that If there are two server's running on the same
host sharing the same UDP port then they will both receive UDP search requests
sent as broadcasts, but unfortunately (due to a weakness of most IP kernel
implementations) only one of the servers will typically receive UDP search
requests sent to unicast addresses (i.e. a single specific host's ip
address).</p>

<h4><a name="Client1">Client Does not See Server's Beacons</a></h4>

<p>Two conclusions deserve special emphasis. <em>First, if a client does not
see the server's beacons, then it will use additional network and server
resources sending periodic state-of-health messages.</em> <em>Second, if a
client does not see a newly introduced server's beacon, then it will take up to
EPICS_CA_MAX_SEARCH_PERIOD to find that newly introduced server.</em> Also,
starting with EPICS R3.14.7 the client library does <em>not</em> suspend
searching for a channel after 100 unsuccessful attempts until a beacon anomaly
is seen. Therefore, if the client library is from before version R3.14.7 of
EPICS and it timed out attempting to find a server whose beacon can't be seen
by the client library then the client application might need to be restarted in
order to connect to this new beacon-out-of-range server. The typical situation
where a client would not see the server's beacon might be when the client isn't
on the same IP subnet as the server, and the client's EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST was
modified to include a destination address for the server, but the server's
beacon address list was not modified so that its beacons are received by the
client.</p>

<h4><a name="Server1">A Server's IP Address Was Changed</a></h4>

<p>When communication over a virtual circuit times out, then each channel
attached to the circuit enters a disconnected state and the disconnect callback
handler specified for the channel is called. However, the circuit is not
disconnected until TCP/IP's internal, typically long duration, keep alive timer
expires. The disconnected channels remain attached to the beleaguered circuit
and no attempt is made to search for, or to reestablish, a new circuit. If, at
some time in the future, the circuit becomes responsive again, then the
attached channels enter a connected state again and reconnect callback
handlers are called. Any monitor subscriptions that received an update message
while the channel was disconnected are also refreshed. If at any time the
library receives an indication from the operating system that a beleaguered
circuit has shutdown or was disconnected then the library will immediately
reattempt to find servers for each channel and connect circuits to them.</p>

<p>A well known negative side effect of the above behavior is that CA clients
will wait the full (typically long) duration of TCP/IP's internal keep alive
timer prior to reconnecting under the following scenario (all of the following
occur):</p>
<ul>
  <li>An server's (IOC's) operating system crashes (or is abruptly turned off)
    or a vxWorks system is stopped by any means</li>
  <li>This operating system does not immediately reboot using the same IP
    address</li>
  <li>A duplicate of the server (IOC) is started appearing at a different IP
    address</li>
</ul>

<p>It is unlikely that any rational organization will advocate the above
scenario in a production system. Nevertheless, there <em>are</em> opportunities
for users to become confused during control system <em>development</em>, but it
is felt that the robustness improvements justify isolated confusion during the
system integration and checkout activities where the above scenarios are most
likely to occur.</p>

<p>Contrast the above behavior with the CA client library behavior of releases
prior to R3.14.5 where the beleaguered circuit was immediately closed when
communication over it timed out. Any attached channels were immediately
searched for, and after successful search responses arrived then attempts were
made to build a new circuit. This behavior could result in undesirable resource
consumption resulting from periodic circuit setup and teardown overhead
(thrashing) during periods of CPU / network / IP kernel buffer congestion.</p>

<h3><a name="Requests">Put Requests Just Prior to Process
Termination Appear to be Ignored</a></h3>

<p>Short lived CA client applications that issue a CA put request and then
immediately exit the process (return from <code>main</code> or call
<code>exit</code>) may find that there request isn't executed. To guarantee
that the request is sent call <code>ca_flush_io()</code> followed by
<code>ca_context_destroy()</code> prior to terminating the process.</p>

<h3><a name="Problems">ENOBUFS Messages</a></h3>

<p>Many Berkley UNIX derived Internet Protocol (IP) kernels use a memory
management scheme with a fixed sized low level memory allocation quantum called
an "mbuf". Messages about "ENOBUFS" are an indication that your IP kernel is
running low on mbuf buffers. An IP kernel mbuf starvation situation may lead to
temporary IP communications stalls or reduced throughput. This issue has to
date been primarily associated with vxWorks systems where mbuf starvation on
earlier vxWorks versions is rumored to lead to permanent IP communications
stalls which are resolved only by a system reboot. IP kernels that use mbufs
frequently allow the initial and maximum number of mbufs to be configured.
Consult your OS's documentation for configuration procedures which vary between
OS and even between different versions of the same OS.</p>

<h4>Contributing Circumstances</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The total number of connected clients is high. Each active socket
    requires dedicated mbufs for protocol control blocks, and for any data that
    might be pending in the operating system for transmission to Channel Access
    or to the network at a given instant. If you increase the vxWorks limit on
    the maximum number of file descriptors then it may also be necessary to
    increase the size of the mbuf pool.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The server has multiple connections where the server's sustained event
    (monitor subscription update) production rate is higher than the client's
    or the network's sustained event consumption rate. This ties up a per
    socket quota of mbufs for data that are pending transmission to the client
    via the network. In particular, if there are multiple clients that
    subscribe for monitor events but do not call <code>ca_pend_event()</code>
    or <code>ca_poll()</code>
    to process their CA input queue, then a significant mbuf consuming backlog
    can occur in the server.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The server does not get a chance to run (because some other higher
    priority thread is running) and the CA clients are sending a high volume of
    data over TCP or UDP. This ties up a quota of mbufs for each socket in the
    server that isn't being reduced by the server's socket read system
  calls.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The server has multiple stale connections. Stale connections occur when a
    client is abruptly turned off or disconnected from the network, and an
    internal "keepalive" timer has not yet expired for the virtual circuit in
    the operating system, and therefore mbufs may be dedicated to unused
    virtual circuits. This situation is made worse if there are active monitor
    subscriptions associated with stale connections which will rapidly increase
    the number of dedicated mbufs to the quota available for each circuit.</li>
  <li>When sites switch to the vxWorks 5.4 IP kernel they frequently run into
    network pool exhaustion problems. This may be because the original vxWorks
    IP kernel expanded the network pool as needed at runtime while the new
    kernel's pool is statically configured at compile time, and does
    <em>not</em> expand as needed at runtime. Also, at certain sites problems
    related to vxWorks network driver pool exhaustion have also been reported
    (this can also result in ENOBUF diagnostic messages).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Related Diagnostics</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The EPICS command "casr [interest level]" displays information about the
    CA server and how many clients are connected.</li>
  <li>The vxWorks command "inetstatShow" indicates how many bytes are pending
    in mbufs and indirectly (based on the number of circuits listed) how many
    mbuf based protocol control blocks have been consumed. The vxWorks commands
    (availability depending on vxWorks version) mbufShow, netStackSysPoolShow,
    and netStackDataPoolShow indicate how much space remains in the network
    stack pool.</li>
  <li>The RTEMS command "netstat [interest level]" displays network information
    including mbuf consumption statistics.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Server Subscription Update Queuing</h3>

<p>If the subscription update producer in the server produces subscription
updates faster than the subscription update consumer in the client consumes
them, then events have to be discarded if the buffering in the server
isn't allowed to grow to an infinite size. This is a law of nature &ndash;
based on queuing theory of course.</p>

<p>What is done depends on the version of the CA server. All server versions
place quotas on the maximum number of subscription updates allowed on the
subscription update queue at any given time. If this limit is reached, an
intervening update is discarded in favor of a more recent update. Depending on
the version of the server, rapidly updating subscriptions are or are not
allowed to cannibalize the quotas of slow updating subscriptions in limited
ways. Nevertheless, there is always room on the queue for at least one update
for each subscription. This guarantees that the most recent update is always
sent.</p>

<p>Adding further complication, the CA client library also implements a
primitive type of flow control. If the client library sees that it is reading a
large number of messages one after another w/o intervening delay it knows that
it is not consuming events as fast as they are produced. In that situation it
sends a message telling the server to temporarily stop sending subscription
update messages. When the client catches up it sends another message asking the
server to resume with subscription updates. This prevents slow clients from
getting time warped, but also guarantees that intervening events are discarded
until the slow client catches up.</p>

<p>There is currently no message on the IOC's console when a particular client
is slow on the uptake. A message of this type used to exist many years ago, but
it was a source of confusion (and what we will call message noise) so it was
removed.</p>

<p>There is unfortunately no field in the protocol allowing the server to
indicate that an intervening subscription update was discarded. We should
probably add that capability in a future version. Such a feature would, for
example, be beneficial when tuning an archiver installation.</p>

<h2><a name="Function">Function Call Interface General Guidelines</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Flushing">Flushing and Blocking</a></h3>

<p>Significant performance gains can be realized when the CA client library
doesn't wait for a response to return from the server after each request. All
requests which require interaction with a CA server are accumulated (buffered)
and not forwarded to the IOC until one of <code>ca_flush_io()</code>,
<code>ca_pend_io()</code>, <code>ca_pend_event()</code>, or
<code>ca_sg_block()</code> are called allowing several operations to be
efficiently sent over the network together. Any process variable values written
into your program's variables by <code>ca_get()</code> should not be referenced by your
program until ECA_NORMAL has been received from <code>ca_pend_io()</code>.</p>

<h3><a name="Status">Status Codes</a></h3>

<p>If successful, the routines described here return the status code
ECA_NORMAL. Unsuccessful status codes returned from the client library are
listed with each routine in this manual. Operations that appear to be valid to
the client can still fail in the server. Writing the string "off" to a floating
point field is an example of this type of error. If the server for a channel is
located in a different address space than the client then the <code>ca_xxx()</code>
operations that communicate with the server return status indicating the
validity of the request and whether it was successfully enqueued to the server,
but communication of completion status is deferred until a user callback is
called, or lacking that an exception handler is called. An error number and the
error's severity are embedded in CA status (error) constants. Applications
shouldn't test the success of a CA function call by checking to see if the
returned value is zero as is the UNIX convention. Below are several methods to
test CA function returns. See <a href="#ca_signal"><code>ca_signal()</code> and
<code>SEVCHK()</code></a> for more information on this topic.</p>
<pre>status = ca_XXXX();
SEVCHK( status, "ca_XXXX() returned failure status");

if ( status &amp; CA_M_SUCCESS ) {
        printf ( "The requested ca_XXXX() operation didn't complete successfully");
}

if ( status != ECA_NORMAL ) {
        printf("The requested ca_XXXX() operation didn't complete successfully because \"%s\"\n",
                ca_message ( status ) );
}</pre>

<h3><a name="Channel">Channel Access Data Types</a></h3>

<p>CA channels form a virtual circuit between a process variable (PV) and a
client side application program. It is possible to connect a wide variety of
data sources into EPICS using the CA server library. When a CA channel
communicates with an EPICS Input Output Controller (IOC) then a field is a
specialization of a PV, and an EPICS record is a plug compatible function block
that contains fields, and the meta data below frequently are mapped onto
specific fields within the EPICS records by the EPICS record support (see the
EPICS Application Developer Guide).</p>

<p>Arguments of type chtype specifying the data type you wish to transfer. They
expect one of the set of DBR_XXXX data type codes defined in db_access.h. There
are data types for all of the C primitive types, and there are also compound (C
structure) types that include various process variable properties such as
units, limits, time stamp, or alarm status. The primitive C types follow a
naming convention where the C typedef dbr_xxxx_t corresponds to the DBR_XXXX
data type code. The compound (C structure) types follow a naming convention
where the C structure tag dbr_xxxx corresponds to the DBR_XXXX data type code.
The following tables provides more details on the structure of the CA data type
space. Since data addresses are passed to the CA client library as typeless
"void *" pointers then care should be taken to ensure that you have passed the
correct C data type corresponding to the DBR_XXXX type that you have specified.
Architecture independent types are provided in db_access.h to assist
programmers in writing portable code. For example "dbr_short_t" should be used
to send or receive type DBR_SHORT. Be aware that type name DBR_INT has been
deprecated in favor of the less confusing type name DBR_SHORT. In practice,
both the DBR_INT type code and the DBR_SHORT type code refer to a 16 bit
integer type, and are functionally equivalent.</p>

<p>Channel value arrays can also be included within the structured CA data
types. If more than one element is requested, then the individual elements can
be accessed in an application program by indexing a pointer to the value field
in the DBR_XXX structure. For example, the following code computes the sum of
the elements in a array process variable and prints its time stamp. The
<code><a href="#dbr_size_n">dbr_size_n</a>()</code> function can be used to determine the correct
number of bytes to reserve when there are more than one value field elements in
a structured CA data type.</p>

<h3><a name="User">User Supplied Callback Functions</a></h3>

<p>Certain CA client initiated requests asynchronously execute an application
supplied callback in the client process when a response arrives. The functions
<code>ca_put_callback()</code>, <code>ca_get_callback()</code>, and
<code>ca_create_subscription()</code> all request notification of
asynchronous completion via this mechanism. The <code>event_handler_args</code>
structure is passed <em>by value</em> to the application supplied
callback. In this structure the <code>dbr</code> field is a void pointer to any
data that might be returned. The <code>status</code> field will be
set to one of the CA error codes in caerr.h and will indicate the status of the
operation performed in the IOC. If the status field isn't set to ECA_NORMAL or
data isn't normally returned from the operation (i.e. put callback) then you
should expect that the <code>dbr</code> field will be set to a null pointer
(zero). The fields <code>usr</code>, <code>chid</code>, and <code>type</code>
are set to the values specified when the request was made by the application.
The <code>dbr</code> pointer, and any data that it points to, are valid only when
executing within the user's callback function.</p>

<h3><a name="Channel1">Channel Access Exceptions</a></h3>

<p>When the server detects a failure, and there is no client callback function
attached to the request, an exception handler is executed in the client. The
default exception handler prints a message on the console and exits if the
exception condition is severe. Certain internal exceptions within the CA client
library, and failures detected by the SEVCHK macro may also cause the exception
handler to be invoked. To modify this behavior see
<code><a href="#ca_add_exception_event">ca_add_exception_event</a>()</code>.</p>

<h3><a name="Server">Server and Client Share the Same Address Space on The Same
Host</a></h3>

<p>If the Process Variable's server and it's client are colocated within the
same memory address space and the same host then the <code>ca_xxx()</code> operations bypass
the server and directly interact with the server tool component (commonly the
IOC's function block database). In this situation the <code>ca_xxx()</code> routines
frequently return the completion status of the requested operation directly to
the caller with no opportunity for asynchronous notification of failure via an
exception handler. Likewise, callbacks may be directly invoked by the CA
library functions that request them.</p>

<h3><a name="Arrays">Arrays</a></h3>

<p>For routines that require an argument specifying the number of array
elements, no more than the process variable's maximum native element count may
be requested. The process variable's maximum native element count is available
from <code>ca_element_count()</code> when the channel is connected. If fewer elements than
the process variable's native element count are requested, the requested values
will be fetched beginning at element zero. By default CA limits the number of
elements in an array to be no more than approximately 16k divided by the size
of one element in the array. Starting with EPICS R3.14 the maximum array size
may be configured in the client and in the server.</p>

<h3><a name="Connection">Connection Management</a></h3>

<p>Application programs should assume that CA servers may be restarted, and
that network connectivity is transient. When you create a CA channel its
initial connection state will most commonly be disconnected. If the Process
Variable's server is available the library will immediately initiate the
necessary actions to make a connection with it. Otherwise, the client library
will monitor the state of servers on the network and connect or reconnect with
the process variable's server as it becomes available. After the channel
connects the application program can freely perform IO operations through the
channel, but should expect that the channel might disconnect at any time due to
network connectivity disruptions or server restarts.</p>

<p>Three methods can be used to determine if a channel is connected: the
application program might call <code><a href="#ca_state">ca_state</a>()</code>
to obtain the current connection state, block in
<code><a href="#ca_pend_io">ca_pend_io</a>()</code> until the channel connects,
or install a connection callback handler when it calls
<code><a href="#ca_create_channel">ca_create_channel</a>()</code>. The
<code><a href="#ca_pend_io">ca_pend_io</a>()</code> approach is best suited to
simple command line programs with short runtime duration, and the connection
callback method is best suited to toolkit components with long runtime duration.
Use of <code><a href="#ca_state">ca_state</a>()</code> is appropriate only in
programs that prefer to poll for connection state changes instead of opting for
asynchronous notification. The <code>ca_pend_io()</code> function blocks only
for channels created specifying a null connection handler callback function. The
user's connection state change function will be run immediately from within
<code><a href="#ca_create_channel">ca_create_channel</a>()</code> if the CA
client and CA server are both hosted within the same address space (within the
same process).</p>

<h3><a name="Thread">Thread Safety and Preemptive Callback to User Code</a></h3>

<p>Starting with EPICS R3.14 the CA client libraries are fully thread safe on
all OS (in past releases the library was thread safe only on vxWorks). When the
client library is initialized the programmer may specify if preemptive callback
is to be enabled. Preemptive callback is disabled by default. If preemptive
callback is enabled, then the user's callback functions might be called by CA's
auxiliary threads when the main initiating channel access thread is not inside
of a function in the channel access client library. Otherwise, the user's
callback functions will be called only when the main initiating channel access
thread is executing inside of the CA client library. When the CA client library
invokes a user's callback function, it will always wait for the current
callback to complete prior to executing another callback function. Programmers
enabling preemptive callback should be familiar with using mutex locks to
create a reliable multi-threaded program.</p>

<p>To set up a traditional single threaded client, you will need code like this
(see <code><a href="#ca_context_create">ca_context_create</a>()</code> and
<a href="#Client2">CA Client Contexts and Application Specific Auxiliary
Threads</a>) .</p>

<p><code>SEVCHK ( ca_context_create(ca_disable_preemptive_callback ),
"application pdq calling ca_context_create" );</code></p>

<p>To set up a preemptive callback enabled CA client context you will need code
like this (see <code><a href="#ca_context_create">ca_context_create</a>()</code> and
<a href="#Client2">CA Client Contexts and Application Specific Auxiliary
Threads</a>).</p>

<p><code>SEVCHK ( ca_context_create(ca_enable_preemptive_callback ),
"application pdq calling ca_context_create" );</code></p>

<h3><a name="Client2">CA Client Contexts and Application Specific Auxiliary
Threads</a></h3>

<p>It is often necessary for several CA client side tools running in the same
address space (process) to be independent of each other. For example, the
database CA links and the sequencer are designed to not use the same CA client
library threads, network circuits, and data structures. Each thread that calls
<code><a href="#ca_context_create">ca_context_create</a>()</code> for the first time either
directly or implicitly when calling any CA library function for the first time,
creates a CA client library context. A CA client library context contains all
of the threads, network circuits, and data structures required to connect and
communicate with the channels that a CA client application has created. The
priority of auxiliary threads spawned by the CA client library are at fixed
offsets from the priority of the thread that called
<code><a href="#ca_context_create">ca_context_create</a>()</code>. An application specific
auxiliary thread can join a CA context by calling
<code><a href="#ca_attach_context">ca_attach_context</a>()</code> using the CA context
identifier that was returned from
<code><a href="#ca_current_context">ca_current_context</a>()</code> when it is called by the
thread that created the context which needs to be joined. A context which is to
be joined must be preemptive - it must be created using
<a href="#ca_context_create">ca_context_create(ca_enable_preemptive_callback)</a>.
It is not possible to attach a thread to a non-preemptive CA context created
explicitly <em>or implicitly</em> with
ca_create_context(ca_disable_preemptive_callback). Once a thread has joined
with a CA context it need only make ordinary <code>ca_xxxx()</code> library calls to use the
context.</p>


<p>A CA client library context can be shut down and cleaned up, after
destroying any channels or application specific threads that are attached to
it, by calling <code><a href="#ca_context_destroy">ca_context_destroy</a>()</code>. The
context may be created and destroyed by different threads as long as they are
both part of the same context.</p>

<h3><a name="Polling">Polling the CA Client Library From Single Threaded
Applications</a></h3>

<p>If preemptive callback is not enabled, then for proper operation CA must
periodically be polled to take care of background activity. This requires that
your application must either wait in one of <code>ca_pend_event()</code>, <code>ca_pend_io()</code>, or
<code>ca_sg_block()</code> or alternatively it should call <code>ca_poll()</code> at least every 100
milliseconds. In single threaded applications a file descriptor manager like
Xt or the interface described in fdManager.h can be used to monitor both mouse
clicks and also CA's file descriptors so that <code>ca_poll()</code> can be called
immediately when CA server messages arrives over the network.</p>

<h3><a name="Avoid">Avoid Emulating Bad Practices that May Still be
Common</a></h3>

<p>With the embryonic releases of EPICS it was a common practice to examine a
channel's connection state, its native type, and its native element count by
directly accessing fields in a structure using a pointer stored in type
<code>chid</code>. Likewise, a user private pointer in the per channel
structure was also commonly set by directly accessing fields in the channel
structure. A number of difficulties arise from this practice, which has long
since been deprecated. For example, prior to release 3.13 it was recognized
that transient changes in certain private fields in the per channel structure
would make it difficult to reliably test the channels connection state using
these private fields directly. Therefore, in release 3.13 the names of certain
fields were changed to discourage this practice. Starting with release 3.14
codes written this way will not compile. Codes intending to maintain the
highest degree of portability over a wide range of EPICS versions should be
especially careful. For example you should replace all instances off
<code>channel_id-&gt;count</code> with
<code>ca_element_count(channel_id)</code>. This approach should be reliable on
all versions of EPICS in use today. The construct <code>ca_puser(chid) =
xxxx</code> is particularly problematic. The best mechanisms for setting the
per channel private pointer will be to pass the user private pointer in when
creating the channel. This approach is implemented on all versions. Otherwise,
you can also use <code>ca_set_puser(CHID,PUSER)</code>, but this function is
available only after the first official (post beta) release of EPICS 3.13.</p>

<h3><a name="Calling">Calling CA Functions from the vxWorks Shell
Thread</a></h3>

<p>Calling CA functions from the vxWorks shell thread is a somewhat
questionable practice for the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The vxWorks shell thread runs at the very highest priority in the system
    and therefore socket calls are made at a priority that is above the
    priority of tNetTask. This has caused problems with the WRS IP kernel in
    the past. That symptom was observed some time ago, but we don't know if
    WRS has fixed the problem.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The vxWorks shell thread runs at the very highest priority in the system
    and therefore certain CA auxiliary threads will not get the priorities that
    are requested for them. This might cause problems only when in a CPU
    saturation situations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If the code does not call <code>ca_context_destroy()</code> (named <code>ca_task_exit()</code> in past
    releases) then resources are left dangling.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In EPICS R3.13 the CA client library installed vxWorks task exit handlers
    behaved strangely if CA functions were called from the vxWorks shell,
    <code>ca_task_exit()</code> wasn't called, and the vxWorks shell restarted. In
    EPICS R3.14 vxWorks task exit handlers are not installed and therefore
    cleanup is solely the responsibility of the user. With EPICS R3.14 the user
    must call <code>ca_context_destroy()</code> or <code>ca_task_exit()</code> to clean up on vxWorks. This
    is the same behavior as on all other OS.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Calling1">Calling CA Functions from POSIX signal
handlers</a></h3>

<p>As you might expect, it isn't safe to call the CA client library from a POSIX
signal handler. Likewise, it isn't safe to call the CA client library from
interrupt context.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="Function Call Reference"></a>Function Call Reference</h2>

<h3><code><a name="ca_context_create">ca_context_create()</a></code></h3>
<pre>#include &lt;cadef.h&gt;
enum ca_preemptive_callback_select
    { ca_disable_preemptive_callback, ca_enable_preemptive_callback };
int ca_context_create ( enum ca_preemptive_callback_select SELECT );</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This function, or <code><a href="#ca_attach_context">ca_attach_context</a>()</code>,
should be called once from each thread prior to making any of the other Channel
Access calls. If one of the above is not called before making other CA calls
then a non-preemptive context is created by default, and future attempts to
create a preemptive context for the current threads will fail.</p>

<p>If <code>ca_disable_preemptive_callback</code> is specified then additional
threads are <em>not</em> allowed to join the CA context using
<code>ca_context_attach()</code> because allowing other threads to join implies that CA
callbacks will be called preemptively from more than one thread.</p>

<h4>Arguments</h4>
<dl>
  <dt><code>SELECT</code></dt>
    <dd>This argument specifies if preemptive invocation of callback functions
      is allowed. If so your callback functions might be called when the thread
      that calls this routine is not executing in the CA client library. There
      are two implications to consider. </dd>
    <dd><p>First, if preemptive callback mode is enabled the developer must
      provide mutual exclusion protection for his data structures. In this mode
      it's possible for two threads to touch the application's data structures
      at once: this might be the initializing thread (the thread that called
      ca_context_create) and also a private thread created by the CA client
      library for the purpose of receiving network messages and calling
      callbacks. It might be prudent for developers who are unfamiliar with
      mutual exclusion locking in a multi-threaded environment to specify
      <code>ca_disable_preemptive_callback</code>. </p>
      <p>Second, if preemptive callback mode is enabled the application is no
      longer burdened with the necessity of periodically polling the CA client
      library in order that it might take care of its background activities. If
      <code>ca_enable_preemptive_callback</code> is specified then CA client
      background activities, such as connection management, will proceed even
      if the thread that calls this routine is not executing in the CA client
      library. Furthermore, in preemptive callback mode callbacks might be
      called with less latency because the library is not required to wait
      until the initializing thread (the thread that called ca_context_create)
      is executing within the CA client library.</p>
    </dd>

<h4>Returns</h4>

<p>ECA_NORMAL - Normal successful completion</p>

<p>ECA_ALLOCMEM - Failed, unable to allocate space in pool</p>

<p>ECA_NOTTHREADED - Current thread is already a member of a non-preemptive

void ca_context_destroy();</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Shut down the calling thread's channel access client context and free any
resources allocated. Detach the calling thread from any CA client context.</p>

<p>Any user-created threads that have attached themselves to the CA context
must stop using it prior to its being destroyed. A program running in an IOC
context must delete all of its channels prior to calling <code>ca_context_destroy()</code>
to avoid a crash.</p>

<p>A CA client application that calls epicsExit() <em>must</em> install an
EPICS exit handler that calls <code>ca_context_destroy()</code> only <em>after</em> first
calling <code>ca_create_context()</code>. This will guarantee that the EPICS exit handlers
get called in the correct order.</p>

<p>On many OS that execute programs in a process based environment the
resources used by the client library such as sockets and allocated memory are
automatically released by the system when the process exits and
<code>ca_context_destroy()</code> hasn't been called, but on light weight systems such as
vxWorks or RTEMS no cleanup occurs unless the application calls
<code>ca_context_destroy()</code>.</p>

<p>Note: This operation blocks until any user callbacks for any channel
created in the current context have run to completion. If callbacks take a
lock (mutex) then it is the user's responsibility to ensure that this lock
is not held when <code>ca_clear_context()</code> is called, otherwise a
deadlock may ensue. (See also

<pre>#include &lt;cadef.h&gt;
typedef void ( caCh ) (struct connection_handler_args);
int ca_create_channel (const char *PVNAME,
        caCh *USERFUNC, void *PUSER,
        capri PRIORITY, chid *PCHID );</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This function creates a CA channel. The CA client library will attempt to
establish and maintain a virtual circuit between the caller's application and a
named process variable in a CA server. Each call to <code>ca_create_channel()</code> allocates
resources in the CA client library and potentially also a CA server. The
function <code>ca_clear_channel()</code> is used to release these resources. If successful,
the routine writes a channel identifier into the user's variable of type
"chid". This identifier can be used with any channel access call that operates
on a channel.</p>

<p>The circuit may be initially connected or disconnected depending on the
state of the network and the location of the channel. A channel will only enter
a connected state after the server's address is determined, and only if channel
access successfully establishes a virtual circuit through the network to the
server. Channel access routines that send a request to a server will return
ECA_DISCONNCHID if the channel is currently disconnected.</p>

<p>There are two ways to obtain asynchronous notification when a channel enters
a connected state.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first and simplest method requires that you call <code>ca_pend_io()</code>, and
    wait for successful completion, prior to using a channel that was created
    specifying a null connection callback function pointer.</li>
  <li>The second method requires that you register a connection handler by
    supplying a valid connection callback function pointer. This connection
    handler is called whenever the connection state of the channel changes. If
    you have installed a connection handler then <code>ca_pend_io()</code> will <em>not</em>
    block waiting for the channel to enter a connected state.</li>
</ul>

<p>The function ca_state(CHID) can be used to test the connection state of a
channel. Valid connections may be isolated from invalid ones with this function
if <code>ca_pend_io()</code> times out.</p>

<p>Due to the inherently transient nature of network connections the order of
connection callbacks relative to the order that <code>ca_create_channel()</code> calls are
made by the application can't be guaranteed, and application programs may need
to be prepared for a connected channel to enter a disconnected state at any
time.</p>

<p>See caExample.c in the example application created by makeBaseApp.pl.</p>

<h4>Arguments</h4>
<dl>
  <dt><code>PVNAME</code></dt>
    <dd>A nil terminated process variable name string. EPICS process control
      function block database variable names are of the form "&lt;record
      name&gt;.&lt;field name&gt;". If the field name and the period separator
      are omitted then the "VAL" field is implicit. For example "RFHV01" and
      "RFHV01.VAL" reference the same EPICS process control function block
      database variable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><code>USERFUNC</code></dt>
    <dd>Optional pointer to the user's callback function to be run when the
      connection state changes. Casual users of channel access may decide to
      set this field to null or 0 if they do not need to have a callback
      function run in response to each connection state change event.
      <p>The following structure is passed <em>by value </em>to the user's
      connection callback function. The <code>op</code> field will
      be set by the CA client library to <code>CA_OP_CONN_UP</code> when the
      channel connects, and to <code>CA_OP_CONN_DOWN</code> when the channel
      disconnects. See <code><a href="#ca_puser">ca_puser</a>()</code> if the
      <code>PUSER</code> argument is required in your callback
      handler<code>.</code></p>

    </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><code>PUSER</code></dt>
    <dd>The value of this void pointer argument is retained in
      storage associated with the specified channel. See the MACROS manual page
      for reading and writing this field. Casual users of channel access may
      wish to set this field to null or 0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><code>PRIORITY</code></dt>
    <dd>The priority level for dispatch within the server or network with 0
      specifying the lowest dispatch priority and 99 the highest. This
      parameter currently does not impact dispatch priorities within the
      client, but this might change in the future. The abstract priority range
      specified is mapped into an operating system specific range of priorities
      within the server. This parameter is ignored if the server is running on
      a network or operating system that does not have native support for
      prioritized delivery or execution respectively. Specifying many different
      priorities within the same program can increase resource consumption in
      the client and the server because an independent virtual circuit, and
      associated data structures, is created for each priority that is used on
      a particular server.</dd>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Shutdown and reclaim resources associated with a channel created by
<code>ca_create_channel()</code>.</p>

<p>All remote operation requests such as the above are accumulated (buffered)
and not forwarded to the IOC until one of <code>ca_flush_io()</code>, <code>ca_pend_io()</code>,
<code>ca_pend_event()</code>, or <code>ca_sg_block()</code> are called. This allows several requests to be
efficiently sent over the network in one message.</p>

<p>Clearing a channel does not cause its disconnect handler to be called, but
clearing a channel does shutdown and reclaim any channel state change event
subscriptions (monitors) registered with the channel.</p>

<p>Note: This operation blocks until any user callbacks for this channel
have run to completion. If callbacks take a lock (mutex) then it is the
user's responsibility to ensure that this lock is not held when

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Write a scalar or array value to a process variable.</p>

<p>When <code>ca_put()</code> or <code>ca_array_put()</code> are invoked the client will receive no response
unless the request can not be fulfilled in the server. If unsuccessful an
exception handler is run on the client side.</p>

<p>When <code>ca_put_callback()</code> or <code>ca_array_put_callback()</code> are invoked the user supplied
asynchronous callback is called only after the initiated write operation, and
all actions resulting from the initiating write operation, complete.</p>

<p>If unsuccessful the callback function is invoked indicating failure status.
</p>

<p>If the channel disconnects before a put callback request can be completed,
then the client's callback function is called with failure status, but this
does not guarantee that the server did not receive and process the request
before the disconnect. If a connection is lost and then resumed outstanding ca
put requests are not automatically reissued following reconnect.</p>

<p>All of these functions return ECA_DISCONN if the channel is currently
disconnected.</p>

<p>All put requests are accumulated (buffered) and not forwarded to the IOC
until one of <code>ca_flush_io()</code>, <code>ca_pend_io()</code>, <code>ca_pend_event()</code>, or <code>ca_sg_block()</code> are called.
This allows several requests to be efficiently combined into one message.</p>

<h4>Description (IOC Database Specific)</h4>

<p>A CA put request causes the record to process if the record's SCAN field is
set to passive, and the field being written has its process passive attribute
set to true. If such a record is already processing when a put request is
initiated the specified field is written immediately, and the record is
scheduled to process again as soon as it finishes processing. Earlier instances
of multiple put requests initiated while the record is being processing may be
discarded, but the last put request initiated is always written and
processed.</p>

<p>A CA put <em>callback</em> request causes the record to process if the
record's SCAN field is set to passive, and the field being written has its
process passive attribute set to true. For such a record, the user's put
callback function is not called until after the record, and any records that
the record links to, finish processing. If such a record is already processing
when a put <em>callback</em> request is initiated the put <em>callback</em>
request is postponed until the record, and any records it links to, finish
processing.</p>

<p>If the record's SCAN field is not set to passive, or the field being written
has its process passive attribute set to false then the CA put or CA put
<em>callback</em> request cause the specified field to be immediately written,
but they do not cause the record to be processed.</p>

  <dt><code>TYPE</code></dt>
    <dd>The external type of the supplied value to be written. Conversion will
      occur if this does not match the native type. Specify one from the set of

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Read a scalar or array value from a process variable.</p>

<p>When <code>ca_get()</code> or <code>ca_array_get()</code> are invoked the returned channel value can't be
assumed to be stable in the application supplied buffer until after ECA_NORMAL
is returned from <code>ca_pend_io()</code>. If a connection is lost outstanding ca get
requests are not automatically reissued following reconnect.</p>

<p>When <code>ca_get_callback()</code> or <code>ca_array_get_callback()</code> are invoked a value is read
from the channel and then the user's callback is invoked with a pointer to the
retrieved value. Note that <code>ca_pend_io()</code> will not block for the delivery of values
requested by <code>ca_get_callback()</code>. If the channel disconnects before a
<code>ca_get_callback()</code> request can be completed, then the client's callback function is
called with failure status.</p>

<p>All of these functions return ECA_DISCONN if the channel is currently
disconnected.</p>

<p>All get requests are accumulated (buffered) and not forwarded to the IOC
until one of <code>ca_flush_io()</code>, <code>ca_pend_io()</code>, <code>ca_pend_event()</code>, or <code>ca_sg_block()</code> are called.
This allows several requests to be efficiently sent over the network in one
message.</p>

<h4>Description (IOC Database Specific)</h4>

<p>A CA get or CA get callback request causes the record's field to be read
immediately independent of whether the record is currently being processed or
not. There is currently no mechanism in place to cause a record to be processed
when a CA get request is initiated.</p>

</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><code>COUNT</code></dt>
    <dd>Element count to be read from the specified channel. Must match the

        evid *PEVID );</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Register a state change subscription and specify a callback function to be
invoked whenever the process variable undergoes significant state changes. A
significant change can be a change in the process variable's value, alarm
status, or alarm severity. In the process control function block database the
deadband field determines the magnitude of a significant change for the
process variable's value. Each call to this function consumes resources in the
client library and potentially a CA server until one of <code>ca_clear_channel()</code> or
<code>ca_clear_subscription()</code> is called.</p>

<p>Subscriptions may be installed or canceled against both connected and
disconnected channels. The specified USERFUNC is called once immediately after
the subscription is installed with the process variable's current state if the
process variable is connected. Otherwise, the specified USERFUNC is called
immediately after establishing a connection (or reconnection) with the process
variable. The specified USERFUNC is called immediately with the process
variable's current state from within <code>ca_create_subscription()</code> if the client and the
process variable share the same address space.</p>

<p>If a subscription is installed on a channel in a disconnected state then the
requested count will be set to the native maximum element count of the channel
if the requested count is larger.</p>

<p>All subscription requests such as the above are accumulated (buffered) and
not forwarded to the IOC until one of <code>ca_flush_io()</code>, <code>ca_pend_io()</code>, <code>ca_pend_event()</code>,
or <code>ca_sg_block()</code> are called. This allows several requests to be efficiently sent
over the network in one message.</p>

<p>If at any time after subscribing, read access to the specified process
variable is lost, then the callback will be invoked immediately indicating
that read access was lost via the status argument. When read access is restored
normal event processing will resume starting always with at least one update
indicating the current state of the channel.</p>

<p>A better name for this function might have been <code>ca_subscribe()</code>.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>See caMonitor.c in the example application created by makeBaseApp.pl.</p>

<h4>Arguments</h4>

</dl>
<dl>

    <dd>This is a pointer to user supplied event id which is overwritten if
      successful. This event id can later be used to clear a specific event.
      This option may be omitted by passing a null pointer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><code>MASK</code></dt>
    <dd>A mask with bits set for each of the event trigger types requested. The
      event trigger mask must be a <em>bitwise or</em> of one or more of the
      following constants.
      <ul>
        <li>DBE_VALUE - Trigger events when the channel value exceeds the
          monitor dead band</li>
        <li>DBE_ARCHIVE (or DBE_LOG) - Trigger events when the channel value
          exceeds the archival dead band</li>
        <li>DBE_ALARM - Trigger events when the channel alarm state changes</li>
        <li>DBE_PROPERTY - Trigger events when a channel property changes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For functions above that do not include a trigger specification,
      events will be triggered when there are significant changes in the
      channel's value or when there are changes in the channel's alarm state.
      This is the same as "DBE_VALUE | DBE_ALARM."</p>

int ca_clear_subscription ( evid EVID );</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Cancel a subscription.</p>

<p>All cancel-subscription requests such as the above are accumulated (buffered)
and not forwarded to the server until one of <code>ca_flush_io()</code>, <code>ca_pend_io()</code>,
<code>ca_pend_event()</code>, or <code>ca_sg_block()</code> are called. This allows several requests to be
efficiently sent together in one message.</p>

<p>Note: This operation blocks until any user callbacks for this channel
have run to completion. If callbacks take a lock (mutex) then it is the
user's responsibility to ensure that this lock is not held when
<code>ca_clear_subscription()</code> is called, otherwise a deadlock may
ensue. (See also <code><a

int ca_pend_io ( double TIMEOUT );</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This function flushes the send buffer and then blocks until outstanding
<code><a href="#ca_get">ca_get</a>()</code> requests complete, and until channels created
specifying null connection handler function pointers connect for the first
time.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If ECA_NORMAL is returned then it can be safely assumed that all
    outstanding <code><a href="#ca_get">ca_get</a>()</code> requests have completed
    successfully and channels created specifying null connection handler
    function pointers have connected for the first time.</li>
  <li>If ECA_TIMEOUT is returned then it must be assumed for all previous
    <code><a href="#ca_get">ca_get</a>()</code> requests and properly qualified first time
    channel connects have failed.</li>
</ul>

<p>If ECA_TIMEOUT is returned then get requests may be reissued followed by a
subsequent call to <code>ca_pend_io()</code>. Specifically, the function will block only for
outstanding <code><a href="#ca_get">ca_get</a>()</code> requests issued, and also any channels
created specifying a null connection handler function pointer, after the last
call to <code>ca_pend_io()</code> or ca client context creation whichever is later. Note
that <code><a href="#ca_create_channel">ca_create_channel</a>()</code> requests generally
should not be reissued for the same process variable unless
<code><a href="#ca_clear_channel">ca_clear_channel</a>()</code> is called first.</p>

<p>If no <code><a href="#ca_get">ca_get</a>()</code> or connection state change events are
outstanding then <code>ca_pend_io()</code> will flush the send buffer and return immediately
<em>without processing any outstanding channel access background
activities</em>.</p>

<p>The delay specified to <code>ca_pend_io()</code> should take into account worst case
network delays such as Ethernet collision exponential back off until
retransmission delays which can be quite long on overloaded networks.</p>

<p>Unlike <code><a href="#ca_pend_event">ca_pend_event</a>()</code>, this routine
will not process CA's background activities if none of the selected IO requests
are pending.</p>

<h4>Arguments</h4>
<dl>
  <dt>TIMEOUT</dt>
    <dd>Specifies the time out interval. A <code>TIMEOUT</code> interval of
      zero specifies forever.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Returns</h4>

<p>ECA_NORMAL - Normal successful completion</p>

<p>ECA_TIMEOUT - Selected IO requests didn't complete before specified
timeout</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This function tests to see if all <code><a href="#ca_get">ca_get</a>()</code> requests are
complete and channels created specifying a null connection callback function
pointer are connected. It will report the status of outstanding
<code><a href="#ca_get">ca_get</a>()</code> requests issued, and channels created specifying a
null connection callback function pointer, after the last call to <code>ca_pend_io()</code>
or CA context initialization whichever is later.</p>

<h4>Returns</h4>

int ca_pend_event ( double TIMEOUT );
int ca_poll ();</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>When <code>ca_pend_event()</code> is invoked the send buffer is flushed and CA background
activity is processed for TIMEOUT seconds.</p>

<p>When <code>ca_poll()</code> is invoked the send buffer is flushed and any outstanding CA
background activity is processed.</p>

<p>The <code>ca_pend_event()</code> function will <em>not</em> return before the specified
timeout expires and all unfinished channel access labor has been processed,
and unlike <code><a href="#ca_pend_io">ca_pend_io</a>()</code> returning from the
function does <em>not </em>indicate anything about the status of pending IO
requests.</p>

<p>Both <code>ca_pend_event()</code> and <code>ca_poll()</code> return ECA_TIMEOUT
when successful. This behavior probably isn't intuitive, but it is preserved to
insure backwards compatibility.</p>

Code</a>.</p>

<h4>Arguments</h4>
<dl>
  <dt><code>TIMEOUT</code></dt>
    <dd>The duration to block in this routine in seconds. A timeout of zero
      seconds blocks forever.</dd>

<h4>Returns</h4>

<p>ECA_TIMEOUT - The operation timed out</p>

<p>ECA_EVDISALLOW - Function inappropriate for use within a callback
handler</p>

<h3><code><a name="ca_flush_io">ca_flush_io()</a></code></h3>
<pre>#include &lt;cadef.h&gt;
int ca_flush_io();</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Flush outstanding IO requests to the server. This routine might be useful
to users who need to flush requests prior to performing client side labor in
parallel with labor performed in the server.</p>

<p>Outstanding requests are also sent whenever the buffer which holds them
becomes full.</p>

<h4>Returns</h4>

<p>ECA_NORMAL - Normal successful completion</p>

<h3><code><a name="ca_signal">ca_signal()</a></code></h3>
<pre>#include &lt;cadef.h&gt;
int ca_signal ( long CA_STATUS, const char * CONTEXT_STRING );
void SEVCHK( CA_STATUS, CONTEXT_STRING );</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Provide the error message character string associated with the supplied
channel access error code and the supplied error context to diagnostics. If the
error code indicates an unsuccessful operation a stack dump is printed, if this
capability is available on the local operating system, and execution is
terminated.</p>

<p>SEVCHK is a macro envelope around <code>ca_signal()</code> which only calls <code>ca_signal()</code> if
the supplied error code indicates an unsuccessful operation. SEVCHK is the
recommended error handler for simple applications which do not wish to write
code testing the status returned from each channel access call.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<pre>status = ca_context_create (...);
SEVCHK ( status, "Unable to create a CA client context" );</pre>

<p>If the application only wishes to print the message associated with an error
code or test the severity of an error there are also functions provided for
this purpose.</p>

<h4>Arguments</h4>

  <dt><code>CA_STATUS</code></dt>
    <dd>The status (error code) returned from a channel access function.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><code>CONTEXT_STRING</code></dt>

typedef void (*pCallback) ( struct exception_handler_args HANDLERARGS );
int ca_add_exception_event ( pCallback  USERFUNC, void *USERARG );</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Replace the currently installed CA context global exception handler callback.</p>

<p>When an error occurs in the server asynchronous to the clients thread then
information about this type of error is passed from the server to the client in
an exception message. When the client receives this exception message an
exception handler callback is called.The default exception handler prints a
diagnostic message on the client's standard out and terminates execution if the
error condition is severe.</p>

<p>Note that certain fields in "struct exception_handler_args" are not
applicable in the context of some error messages. For instance, a failed get
will supply the address in the client task where the returned value was
requested to be written. For other failed operations the value of the addr
field should not be used.</p>

<h4>Arguments</h4>
<dl>
  <dt><code>USERFUNC</code></dt>
    <dd>Pointer to a user callback function to be executed when exceptions
      occur. Passing a null value causes the default exception handler to be

      callback function. Currently, the <code>op</code> field can be one of
      <code>CA_OP_GET, CA_OP_PUT, CA_OP_CREATE_CHANNEL, CA_OP_ADD_EVENT,
      CA_OP_CLEAR_EVENT, or CA_OP_OTHER.</code>

<pre>#include &lt;cadef.h&gt;
int ca_add_fd_registration ( void ( USERFUNC * ) ( void *USERARG, int FD, int OPENED ), void * USERARG )</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>For use with the services provided by a file descriptor manager (IO
multiplexor) such as "fdmgr.c". A file descriptor manager is often needed when
two file descriptor IO intensive libraries such as the EPICS channel access
client library and the X window system client library must coexist in the same
UNIX process. This function allows an application code to be notified whenever
the CA client library places a new file descriptor into service and whenever
the CA client library removes a file descriptor from service. Specifying
USERFUNC=NULL disables file descriptor registration (this is the default).</p>

<h4>Arguments</h4>

<p>USERFUNC</p>

<p>Pointer to a user supplied C function returning null with the above
arguments.</p>

<p>USERARG</p>

<p>User supplied pointer sized variable passed to the above function.</p>

<p>FD </p>

<p>A file descriptor.</p>

<p>OPENED </p>

<p>Boolean argument is true if the file descriptor was opened and false if the
file descriptor was closed.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<pre>int s;
static struct myStruct aStruct;

void fdReg ( struct myStruct *pStruct, int fd, int opened )
{
    if ( opened ) printf ( "fd %d was opened\n", fd );
    else printf ( "fd %d was closed\n", fd );
}
s = ca_add_fd_registration ( fdReg, &amp; aStruct );
SEVCHK ( s, NULL );</pre>

<h4>Comments</h4>

<p>When using this function it is advisable to call it only once prior to
calling any other CA function, or once just after creating the CA context (if
you create the context explicitly). Use of this interface can improve latency
slightly in applications that use non preemptive callback mode at the expense
of some additional runtime overhead when compared to the alternative which is
just polling <code>ca_pend_event()</code> periodically. It would probably not be appropriate
to use this function with preemptive callback mode. Starting with R3.14 this
function is implemented in a special backward compatibility mode. if
<code>ca_add_fd_registration()</code> is called, a single pseudo UDP fd is
created which CA pokes whenever something significant happens. Xt and others
can watch this fd so that backwards compatibility is preserved, and so that
they will not need to use preemptive callback mode but they will nevertheless
get the lowest latency response to the arrival of CA messages.</p>

<h3><code><a name="ca_sg_create">ca_sg_create()</a></code></h3>
<pre>#include &lt;cadef.h&gt;
int ca_sg_create ( CA_SYNC_GID *PGID );</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Create a synchronous group and return an identifier for it.</p>

<p>A synchronous group can be used to guarantee that a set of channel access
requests have completed. Once a synchronous group has been created then channel
access get and put requests may be issued within it using
<code>ca_sg_array_get()</code> and <code>ca_sg_array_put()</code> respectively.
The routines <code>ca_sg_block()</code> and <code>ca_sg_test()</code> can be
used to block for and test for completion respectively. The routine
<code>ca_sg_reset()</code> is used to discard knowledge of old requests which
have timed out and in all likelihood will never be satisfied.</p>

<p>Any number of asynchronous groups can have application requested operations
outstanding within them at any given time.</p>

<h4>Arguments</h4>
<dl>
  <dt><code>PGID</code></dt>
    <dd>Pointer to a user supplied CA_SYNC_GID.</dd>

<h3><code><a name="ca_sg_block">ca_sg_block()</a></code></h3>
<pre>#include &lt;cadef.h&gt;
int ca_sg_block ( CA_SYNC_GID GID, double TIMEOUT );</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Flushes the send buffer and then waits until outstanding requests complete
or the specified time out expires. At this time outstanding requests include
calls to <code>ca_sg_array_get()</code> and calls to <code>ca_sg_array_put()</code>. If ECA_TIMEOUT is
returned then failure must be assumed for all outstanding queries. Operations
can be reissued followed by another <code>ca_sg_block()</code>. This routine will only block
on outstanding queries issued after the last call to <code>ca_sg_block()</code>,
<code>ca_sg_reset()</code>, or <code>ca_sg_create()</code> whichever occurs later in time. If no queries
are outstanding then <code>ca_sg_block()</code> will return immediately without processing
any pending channel access activities.</p>

<p>Values written into your program's variables by a channel access synchronous
group request should not be referenced by your program until ECA_NORMAL has
been received from <code>ca_sg_block()</code>. This routine will process pending channel
access background activity while it is waiting.</p>

<h4>Arguments</h4>
<dl>
  <dt><code>GID</code></dt>
    <dd>Identifier of the synchronous group.</dd>
  <dt><code>TIMEOUT</code></dt>
    <dd>The duration to block in this routine in seconds. A timeout of zero
      seconds blocks forever.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<pre>CA_SYNC_GID gid;
status = ca_sg_block(gid, 0.0);
SEVCHK(status, Sync group block failed);</pre>

<h4>Returns</h4>

<p>ECA_NORMAL - Normal successful completion</p>

<p>ECA_TIMEOUT - The operation timed out</p>

<p>ECA_EVDISALLOW - Function inappropriate for use within an event handler</p>

<p>ECA_BADSYNCGRP - Invalid synchronous group</p>

<p>Write a value, or array of values, to a channel and increment the outstanding
request count of a synchronous group. The <code>ca_sg_put()</code> and
<code>ca_sg_array_put()</code> functionality is implemented using
