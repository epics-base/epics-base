 * \brief General purpose task watchdog.
 * \author  Marty Kraimer
 * \date 07-18-91
 * 
 * EPICS provides a task that acts as a watchdog for other tasks. Any task can request
 * to be watched, and most of the IOC tasks do this. A status monitoring subsystem in
 * the IOC can register to be notiﬁed about any changes that occur. The watchdog
 * task runs periodically and checks each task in its task list. If any task is
 * suspended, an error message is displayed and any notiﬁcations made.
