# RELEASE Locations of external modules

# NOTE: The build does not check dependancies on files
# external to this application. Thus you should run
# "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the top directory
# each time EPICS_BASE or any other external module that
# is defined in a RELEASE* file gets rebuilt.
#
# Host/target specific paths can be specified in files named
#   RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#   RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#   RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)

# Define INSTALL_LOCATION in CONFIG_SITE
